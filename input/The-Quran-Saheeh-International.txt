INTRODUCTION
All praise is due to AllŒh; and blessings and peace be upon 
His messenger and servant, Muúammad, and upon his family and 
companions and whoever follows his guidance until the Day of 
Resurrection.
There is clearly a need for a presentation of the meanings of 
the Holy QurÕ Œn in English which is precise enough to be useful as 
a reference for Muslims and students of Arabic yet also suitable for 
daÔwah purposes to non-Muslims.  The Arabic QurÕŒn has alwa ys 
spoken for itself –to those who discover it for the first time as well 
as to those who study it in depth.  The general meanings in a 
translation should thus be correct, as far as human ability permits, 
and clear, in a readable and uncomplicated express ion.
Al-MuntadŒ al-IslŒmi has selected this edition by êaúeeú 
International (first published by Abul -Qasim Publishing House, 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) as the one most suitable for distribution.  
Widely acknowledged for improvement over previous translations, 
its language closely adheres to that of the original text while 
remaining lucid and intelligible.
Without going into excessive detail, a word is due about the 
methodology of this abbreviated edition.  Three main objectives 
served as guidelines for the wor k:
1.To present correct meanings, as far as possible, in accordance
with the Ôaqeedah ofAhl as -Sunnah wal -JamŒÔah
2.To simplify and clarify the language for the benefit of all 
readers
3.To let the QurÕŒn speak for itself, adding footnotes only 
where deemed neces sary for explanation of points not readily 
understood or when more than one meaning is acceptable
Each verse was reviewed in Arabic with reference to several 
works of tafseer and grammar.  Where differences arose, explanations
were generally taken from an authentic úad¥th or, in the absence of 

Page 12:
iisuch, those by the most knowledgable of the §aúŒ bah and tŒbiÔ´n
as quoted by Ibn Katheer.1
English word order was chosen to conform more closely with 
that of the Arabic text.  This facilitates compariso n for the student, 
and the reader is brought somewhat closer to the feel of the original 
expression.  Transliterated Arabic terms have been avoided 
wherever an English definition could serve, keeping exceptions to a 
minimum.  Necessary clarifications or additions are given in 
footnotes.  Care has also been taken to avoid the definitions of 
modern Arabic dictionaries, which are often variant with the 
language of the QurÕŒn and reflect the degree of change which has 
crept into the understanding of certain con cepts with the passing of 
time.  Instead, classical definitions were applied.
In compliance with standard regulations, words not derived 
from the Arabic text but added for the purpose of clarification or 
the completion of E nglish meaning have been enclose d in brackets.  
The exception is in regard to the frequently occurring expressions 
of "association of another with AllŒh" (shirk ) and "fearing AllŒh" 
(taqwŒ ), where the divine name, although not always included in 
the Arabic text, is understood to be an in tegral part of that concept.   
Throughout this work there is an endeavor to be consistent in the 
translation of oft -repeated words and phrases from the text.  There 
are, however, specific instances where some adjustment is required 
for accuracy, necessitati ng exceptions to the rule.
                                               
1The §aúŒ bah (companions) were those most familiar with the time, place 
and circumstances of each revelation due to their close contact with the 
Prophet () and their eagerness to understand its every aspect.  At the 
same time, acute awareness of their accountability before AllŒh prevented 
them from answering any questions or making assertions about that of 
which they were not completely certain.
The tŒbiÔ´n(followers) were students of the §aúŒ bahwho mentioned the 
sources for whatever commentaries they offered.  Of their statements only 
those based upon knowledge taken from the §aúŒ bahand upon the literal 
and logical meanings understood in the Arabic language have been 
accepted.  Explanations from other sources, such as Jewish and Christian 
narratives, are disregarded as unreliable.

Page 13:
iiiIt is to be noted that Arabic is a richer language than most.  
One well versed therein automatically perceives the multiple shades 
of meaning contained in particular words and phrases.  Both early 
and later scholars emphasized some aspects more than others in 
their commentaries according to their own understanding, especially
in the absence of a relevant and authentic prophetic úad¥th.   Any 
translation, which can reflect but one emphasis, must necessarily 
appear as a severe limit ation.  Although additions in brackets and 
explanatory footnotes are a partial remedy, it remains to be said that 
nothing can take the place of an in -depth study through the Arabic 
medium itself.
Arabic is richer not only in vocabulary but also in 
grammat ical possibilities.  Again, English is hardly comparable in 
this respect.  While precise and logical, Arabic grammar is free of 
many limitations found in that of other languages, allowing for 
much wider expression.  For this reason, undoubtedly, it was the
most suitable of human tongues for conveyance of the Creator's 
message to mankind.  Due to the flexibility of Arabic tenses, the 
QurÕŒn is unique in its graphic portrayal of occurrences in the 
Hereafter.  Through use of the past tense the feeling is given that 
one is already there, having experienced what is described.  Much 
of this is lost  in English, where such descriptions are confined to 
"will" of the future.
Those unfamiliar with QurÕ Œnic style might question the shifting
of pronouns in many verses, which is again, alien to English.  This 
cannot be eliminated in translation, however, without loss to intended
meanings.  Far from showing inconsistency, such variations are not 
only correct in the original language but are the source of its beauty 
and precision, which unfortunately cannot be captured in another 
tongue.  It must be remembered that the Arabic QurÕŒn, being the 
words of AllŒh, the Exalted, far surpasses any human endeavor in 
linguistic excellence and is indeed the standard of perfection for a ll 
Arabic expression.
Asfor the names and attributes of AllŒh, their translation is 
surely an impossibility, for even in Arabic they cannot represent 

Page 14:
ivmore than an approximation limited by human understa nding.  To 
any description given by AllŒh of Himself in human terminology, 
the mind is required to apply the concept of absoluteness and 
perfection befitting Him.  Ibn Taymiyyah stated consisely that true 
belief in All Œh (i.e., the correct Isl Œmic Ôaqeedah of Ahl as -Sunnah ) 
includes belief in whatever is de scribed in His Book (the QurÕ Œn) or
through His Prophet (Muúammad ) –belief that is free from 
distortion,2suspension,3qualification4or comparison.5  The same 
can be said for those aspects of the unseen, such as Paradise and 
Hellfire, which are beyond the limits of human language and 
human imagination.
In this edition particular attention has been given to t he names
"ar-RaúmŒn ar -Raúeem "(explained in a footnote to S´rah al -FŒtiúah,
verse 1).  Since both express certain aspects of divine mercy, "the 
Most Merciful" was used for ar-RaúmŒn and simply "the Merciful" 
for ar-Raúeem. However, when they occur together, as in S´rah 
al-FŒtiúah, the adjectives "entirely" and "especially" have been 
used to indicate the complementary relationship between the two.
To those who use this volume, it should be emphasized that 
whenever in doubt, one should refer to dictionaries of the classical 
language and to reliable Arab ic tafseer.   Despite the many technicalities 
involved in a work of this sort that can predispose itto possible 
imperfections, al-MuntadŒ is optimistic that the present effort will 
contribute to a better understanding of the QurÕŒn for English -speaking
people in every part of the world.
Ultimately, all success is from All Œh,
and all praise is due to Him .
                                               
2Taúreef :  Applying an allegorical meaning which will inevitably be 
incorrect since it is not based upon knowledge.3TaÔ‹ee l:  Desertion of the concept altogether or denial that All Œh would have 
such an attribute or quality.4Takyeef :  Attempting to explain how a certain attribute or quality could be, 
while such knowledge lies only with All Œh.5Tamtheel :  Supposing that divine attributes resemble those of creation, 
while All Œh has said, "There is nothing like unto Him." (42:11 )

vFOREWORD
Scholars have defined the QurÕŒn as "the words of AllŒh6
revealed to Muúammad (), the recitation of which is a form of 
worship."7  This definition can be applied to no other book or speech.
Reading and recitation of the QurÕŒn is an importan t form of 
worship for which a Muslim can expect reward and benefit in 
the Hereafter.  There was a definite purpose behind the strong 
encouragement given by the Prophet () in several authentic 
úad¥ths for recitation of the QurÕ Œn.8  That purpose is clearl y stated 
in the QurÕ Œn itself:

"Then do they not reflect upon the QurÕ Œn?  If it had

found within it much contradiction. "11
                                               
6"AllŒh" is the proper name of God and is not used to denote any other 
being.  Therefore, this name is retained in translation to other languages.7Al-Qa‹‹Œn, Mann ŒÔ, MabŒúith f¥ ÔUl´m il -QurÕŒn,p. 21.8The recitation whose merits are mentioned in the úad¥ths is that of the 
actual words of AllŒh in their original Arabic form.  Nevertheless, any 
effort toward understanding the QurÕ Œn's meanings in ord er to increase faith, 
obtain guidance and live by its ordinances is in itself a deed of great merit.9S´rah êŒd, 38:29 .10S´rah Muúammad, 47:24 .11S´rah an -NisŒÕ, 4:82.

FatŒwŒ that even the ordinary w ords of men are spoken or written 
for the purpose of being understood by the listener or reader and 
that the QurÕ Œn is surely more worthy of being understood than the 
words of men.  Many scholars have stated that it is the responsibility
of all Muslims to learn the Arabic language in order to understand 
the QurÕŒn.  Ibn Katheer, author of the well-known Arabic tafseer,
maintained that it is also the duty of Muslim scholars to make its 
meanings known to the people.
No person can afford to be ignorant of the QurÕŒn, for it is the 
constitution revealed by All Œh to regulate and govern human life.  It 
speaks with the perfect knowledge of the Creator about His 
creation.  It exposes the truth and invites man to the way of truth.  It 
contains important information about human destiny and that of the 
individual.  It educates and raises men to the highest moral, 
intellectual and social level when they strive to comprehend it and 
apply its teachings to life.
Moreover, it is the actual words of AllŒh –not created, but
revealed by Him through the angel Gabriel to a human messenger, 
Muúammad bin ÔAbdullŒh (), for the benefit of humanity.  It is 
an eternal miracle given to the final prophet, Muúammad (), as 
proof of his prophethood and a challenge to all succeeding gene rations.
It is of unique and inimitable quality.  Revealed fourteen centuries 
ago, it remains today completely intact and unaltered in its original 
Arabic form.
What does one discover when he understands the meanings of 
the QurÕŒn?  The answers to this question can be classified in four 
main categories:
1.That he can know his Creator as He has described Himself
2.That he can know the purpose of life on this earth and what 
is expected of every person during this life
3.That he becomes aware of the co nsequences of his attitudes 
and his behavior
4.How he should relate to all things –to AllŒh by worship 
and obedience, to his fellow man by justice to all or by

viiiúsŒn (a higher degree),12and to the universe in general by 
putting those things under his co ntrol to good use
This divine message was revealed to confirm and renew the 
relationship between man and his Creator and to reinstate the 
sincere and correct worship of the one true God, All Œh (subúŒnahu 
wa taÔŒlŒ ), who says:
ﻭﻥﹶ﴿ ﺪﺮﺷﻢ ﻳﻠﱠﻬﻮﺍ ﺑﹺﻲ ﻟﹶﻌﻨﺆﻣﻟﻴﻲ ﻭﻮﺍ ﻟﺠﹺﻴﺒﺴﺘ﴾ﻓﹶﻠﻴ 
"Then let them respond to Me and believe in Me that 
they may be [rightly] guided. "13
                                               
12IúsŒn has been defined by the Prophet () as "worshipping AllŒh as if 
you see Him" or generally, doing more than one's duty and expecting less 
than one's right.13S´rah al -Baqarah, 2:186 .

viiiHISTORY OF QURÕN COMPILATION
1.In addition to its memorization in entirety by many of the 
§aúŒ bah (the Proph et's companions), written recording of the 
QurÕŒn began during the Prophet's lifetime.  As it was recited by 
him, his scribes wrote down the revelation on pieces of leather, 
bone and palm leaves, and its verses were ordered and arranged 
as AllŒh revealed. Initially, the QurÕ Œn was not compiled in one 
volume, although some of the §aúŒ bahhad made personal copies 
for themselves after memorizing it from the Prophet ().
2.Collecting and compiling the QurÕŒn followed soon after the 
Prophet's death, during the caliphate of Ab´ Bakr a§-êiddeeq .  
Upon the advice of ÔUmar bin al-Kha‹‹ Œb, Ab´ Bakr charged 
Zayd bin ThŒbit to bring all of the QurÕŒn together on written 
sheet s (§uúu f).  These were checked for accuracy against what 
had been memorized by a great number of the §aúŒ bah.  After 
the death of Ab´ Bakr and then ÔUmar, the collection remained 
with ÔUmar's daughter, îaf§ah, who was also the Prophet's wife.
3.The standa rdization of one authentic volume ( mu§úa f) took place 
during the caliphate of ÔUthmŒn bin ÔAffŒn.  The copy kept by 
îaf§ah was obtained and, upon the order of ÔUthmŒn, it was 
transcribed with great care by four of the most knowledgeable 
scribes:  Zayd bin ThŒbit, ÔAbdull Œh bin az-Zubayr, SaÔeed bin 
al-ÔAa§ and ÔAbdur -Raúm Œn bin al-îŒrith bin HishŒm .  Copies 
were sent to each of the various Islamic territories to replace all 
other collections in circulation.  ÔUthmŒn kept a copy in Mad¥nah,
and the original §uúuf were returned to îaf§ah.  There is consensus
by the §aúŒ bahthat what is contained in this standard copy is the 
true revelation received by Muúammad ()from AllŒh, the Exalted.
4.The mu§úaf of ÔUthm Œn had no dots or vowel marks, as they 
were unnecessary for those who knew the pure Arabic tongue.  
With the spread of IslŒm among other peoples, there arose a 
need to guard against incorrect reading and misinterpretation of 
the QurÕ Œn.  At first, scholars were reluctant about these additions,
but it was finally agreed that they did not affect the text itself and 

Page 19:
ixwere merely aids to proper pronunciation and understanding.  
They were introduced in three stage s:
Short vowel sounds were first represented by dots positioned 
above, below and to the left of the letter.  This system was 
introduced during the caliphate of MuÔŒwiyah bin Ab¥ Sufy Œn
by Abul -Aswad ad-DuÕl¥ after he had heard serious errors in 
recitati on of the QurÕ Œn.
Similarly written letters were differentiated by another system 
of dots above and below them during the caliphate of ÔAbdul -
Malik bin MarwŒn.  At the caliph's order, his governor, al-îajjŒj, 
appointed two scholars, Na§r bin Ô§im and îayy bin YaÔm´r , 
to implement this improvement.
The presently used system of short vowel symbols was devised
by al-Khaleel bin Aúmad al-FarŒheed¥ during the Abbasine 
period.

xMERITS OF PARTICULAR SçRAHS
AND VERSES
1.Ab´ SaÔeed RŒfiÔ bin al -MuÔallŒ said:  "All Œh's Messenger ()said,
'Shall I not teach you the most superior s´rah in the QurÕŒn 
before you leave the mosque?'  He took me by the hand.  When 
we were about to leave, I said, 'O Messenger of All Œh, you said 
you would teach me the most superior s´rah in the QurÕŒn.'  
The Prophet ()said, '"Praise to AllŒh, Lord of the worlds"
[i.e., S´rah al -FŒtiúah ]; it is the seven repeatedly recited verses 
and the magnificent QurÕ Œn which was given to me. '" (Narrated 
by al-BukhŒr¥ .)
2.Ibn ÔAbb Œs narrated:  "While Gabriel was sitting with the 
Prophet (),he heard a creaking sound above him, and raising 
his head he said, 'This is a gate opened in Heaven today which 
has never been opened before.'  Then when an angel descended 
through it, he said, 'This is an angel that came down to earth 
who has never come down before.'  He gave a salutation and 
said, 'Rejoice in two lights brought to you which have not been 
brought to any prophet before you:  FŒtiúat al-KitŒb and the 
last verses of S´rah al -Baqarah.   You will not recite a letter of 
them without being given the blessing it contains. '" (Narrated 
by Muslim.)
3.Ab´ Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "Do not 
make your houses into graveyards.  The devil flees from the house
in which S´rah al -Baqarah is recited." (Narrated by Muslim.)
4.Ubayy bin KaÔb narrated:  "All Œh's Messenger ()said, 'Abul -
Mundhir, do you know which verse of All Œh's Bo ok you have is 
greatest?'  I replied, 'AllŒh –there is no deity except Him, the 
Ever -Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.' [2:255 ]  
Thereupon he struck me on the breast and said, 'May knowledge
be pleasant for you, Abul -Mundhir. '" (Narrated by Muslim .)
5.Ab´ MasÔ´d al-Badr¥ narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "If 
anyone recites the last two verses of S´rah al -Baqarah at night, 
it will be sufficient for him." (Narrated by al -BukhŒr¥ and Muslim.)

Page 21:
xi6.Ab´ UmŒmah al -BŒhil¥ narrated that he heard All Œh's Messenger () 
say:  "Recite the QurÕ Œn, for on the D ay of Resurrection it will 
come as an intercessor for those who recite it.  Recite the two 
bright ones, al-Baqarah and li ÔImrŒn, for on the Day of 
Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades or two 
flocks of birds in ranks pleading for those who recite them.  
Recite S´rah al-Baqarah, for reading it produces blessing, and 
abandoning it produces regret.  And magicians are unable to 
recite it." (Narrated by Muslim.)
7.Ab´ Dard ŒÕnarrated that the Prophet ()said:  "If anyone 
learns by heart th e first ten verses of S´rah al -Kahf, he will be 
protected from the DajjŒl."  In another version, he said:  "...at 
the end of S´rah al -Kahf. "  (Narrated by Muslim.)
8.Ab´ SaÔeed narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "If anyone 
recites S´rah al -Kahf on Frid ay, light will shine brightly for him
until the next Friday." (Narrated by al -îŒkim and al-Bayúaq¥ –
an authentic úad¥th. )
9.Ibn MasÔ´d narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "S´rah TabŒrak
prevents [whoever reads it] from the punishment of the grave." 
(Narrated by al -îŒkim and Ab´ NaÔeem –an authentic úad¥th. )
10.Ibn ÔUmar narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "Whoever would 
like to see the Day of Resurrection as if with his own eyes may 
recite S´rahs at -Takweer, al-Infi‹Œr and al-InshiqŒq. " (Narrated 
by Aúmad, at -Tirmidh¥ and al -îŒkim –a good úad¥th. )
11.Ab´ SaÔeed al-Khudr¥ narrated that the Prophet ()said 
regarding, "Say He is AllŒh, [who is] One" (i.e., S´rah al -IkhlŒ §):  
"By Him in whose hand my life is, this s´rah is equal to one
third of the Qur ÕŒn."  And in another úad¥th :  "The Prophet ()
said to his companions, 'Is it difficu lt for any of you to recite 
one third of the QurÕŒn in one night?'  This was difficult for 
them, so they said, 'Who among us has the ability to do so, O 
Messenger of AllŒh?'  AllŒh's Messenger ()replied, '"Say, 
He is AllŒh, the One; AllŒh, the Eternal, Absolute" [i.e., 
S´rah al -IkhlŒ§ ] is equal to one third of the QurÕ Œn.'" (Narrated 
by al-BukhŒr¥ .)

Page 22:
xii12.MuÔŒdh bin Anas narrated that the Prophet ()said:  "If 
someone recites, 'Say, He is AllŒh, the One' ten times, AllŒh 
will build for him a palace in Paradise." (Narrated by Aúmad.)
13.ÔUqbah bin Ômir narrated that AllŒh's Messenger ()said:  
"What wonderful verses have been sent down tonight.  The like 
of them has neve r been seen!  They are:  'Say, I seek refuge in 
the Lord of the dawn,' and 'Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of 
men. '" (i.e., S´rahs al -Falaq and an-NŒs) (Narrated by Muslim.)
14.ÔÕishah narrated:  "When the Prophet ()went to bed every night,
he used to cup his hands together and blow over them after 
reciting S´rah al -IkhlŒ§, S´rah al -Falaq and S´rah an -NŒs and 
then rub his hands over whatever parts of his body he was able 
to, starting with his head, face and front of his body.  He used 
to do that three t imes." (Narrated by al-BukhŒr¥ and Muslim.)
15.ÔAbdull Œh bin Y´suf said that MŒlik reported from Ibn ShihŒb from 
ÔUrwah that ÔÕishah narrated:  "Whenever AllŒh's Messenger ()
became sick, he would recite the muÔawwidhŒt [i.e., S´rahs 
al-Falaq and an-NŒs] and then blow over his body.  But when he
became seriously ill, I used to recite them and rub his hands over
his body hoping for their blessings." (Narrated by al-BukhŒr¥ .)

1S´rah al -FŒtiúah1
1.In the name of All Œh,2the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful .3
2.[All] praise is [due] to All Œh, Lord4of the worlds –
3.The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
4.Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.5
5.It is You we worship and You we ask for help.
6.Guide us to the straight path –
7.The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of 
those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.
                                               
1Al-FŒtiúah :  The Opening (of the QurÕŒn).  Note:  S´rah titles are not an 
integral part of the QurÕ Œn.  A distinguishing word in a particular s´rah or a 
word defining its subject matter often became a common means of 
identification among the Prophet's companions and later scholars.  Although
some names, such as al-FŒtiúah, were used by the Prophet ( ) in reference 
to a particular s´rah, they were not specifically designated by him as titles.2AllŒh is a proper name belonging only to the one Almighty God, Creator 
and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them, the 
Eternal and Absolute, to whom alone all worship is due.3Ar-RaúmŒn and ar-Raúeem are two names of All Œh derived from the word 
"raúmah " (mercy).  In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of 
"merciful" (i.e., extrem ely merciful).  A complimentary and comprehensive 
meaning is intended by using both together.
RaúmŒn is used only to describe AllŒh, while raúeem might be used to 
describe a person as well.  The Prophet ( ) was described in the QurÕ Œn as 
raúeem.  RaúmŒn is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful).  Since 
one usually understands intensity to be something of short duration, AllŒh 
describes Himself also as raúeem (i.e., continually merciful).
RaúmŒn also carries a wider meaning –merciful to all creation.  Justice 
is a part of this mercy.  Raúeem includes the concept of speciality –
especially and specifically merciful to the believers.  Forgiveness is a part 
of this mercy.  (See al -Qur‹ub¥'s al-JŒmi Ôu li AúkŒmil -QurÕŒn, pp. 103-107.)4When referring to AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ), the Arabic term "rabb" 
(translated as "Lord") includes all of the following meanings:  "owner, 
master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker."5i.e., repayment and compensation for whatever was earned of good or evil 
during life on this earth.

Muúammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the 
Hereafter they are certain [in faith].
5.Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those

6.Indeed, those who disbelieve11–it is all the same for them

7.AllŒh has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing,

6Al-Baqarah :  The Cow .  The name is taken from the story in verses 67-73.7These are among the fourteen opening letters which occur in various 
combinations at the beginning of twenty -nine s´rahs in the QurÕŒn.  
Although there has been much speculation as to their meaning, it was not, 
in fact, revealed by All Œh to anyone and is known only to Him.8Literally, "those who have taqwŒ, " i.e., who have piety, righteous ness, fear 
and love of All Œh, and who take great care to avoid His displeasure.9At its proper times and according to its specified conditions.10It is to be noted that the reference of AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) to 
Himself as "We" in many QurÕ Œnic verses is necessarily understood in the 
Arabic language to denote grandeur and power, as opposed to the more 
intimate singular form "I" used in specific instances.11Literally, "cover" or "conceal" (faith or truth).12A covering preventing them from discerning guid ance.  This condition is a 
direct result of their arrogance and persistence in sin.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
38.And of the people are some who say, "We believe in AllŒh 
and the Last Day," but they are not believers.
9.They [think to] deceive All Œh and those who believe, but they 
deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.
10.In their hearts is disease, so All Œh has increased their disease;13
and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] 
used to lie.
11.And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the 
earth," they say, "We are but reformers."
12.Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they 
perceive [it] not.
13.And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have 
believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have 
believed?"  Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but 
they know [it] not.
14.And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We b elieve";
but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, 
"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers."
15.[But] AllŒh mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression
[while] they wander blindly.
16.Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] 
for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor 
were they guided.
17.Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it 
illuminated what was around him, All Œh took away their light 
and left them in darkness [so] th ey could not see.
18.Deaf, dumb and blind –so they will not return [to the right 
path].
19.Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is 
darkness, thunder and lightning.  They put their fingers in 
                                               
13The "disease" mentioned here includes doubt, hypocrisy, arrogance and 
disbelief.

4their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death.  But 
AllŒh is encompassing14of the disbelievers.
20.The lightning almost snatches away their sight.  Every time it 
lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness
comes over them, they stand [still].  And if AllŒh had willed, 
He could have taken away their hearing and their sight.  
Indeed, All Œh is over all things competent.
21.O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those 
before you, that you may become righteous –
22.[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the 
sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth
thereby fruits as provision for you.  So do not attribute to All Œh 
equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].
23.And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down [i.e., 
the QurÕ Œn] upon Our Servant [i.e., Prophet Muúammad ()], 
then produce a s´rah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses
[i.e., supporters] other than All Œh, if you should be truthful.
24.But if you do not –and you will never be able to –then fear 
the Fire, whose fuel is m en and stones, prepared for the 
disbelievers.
25.And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous 
deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which 
rivers flow.  Whenever they are provided with a provision of 
fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided 
                                               
14AllŒh states in the QurÕŒn that He has certain attributes such as hearing, 
sight, hands, face, mercy, anger, coming, encompassing, being above the 
Throne, etc.  Yet, He has disassociated Himself from the limitations of 
human attributes or human imagination.  Correct IslŒmic belief requires 
faith in the existence of these attributes as AllŒh has described them 
without applying to them any allegorical meanings or attempting to 
explain how a certain quality could be (while this is known only to All Œh) 
and without comparing them to creation or denying that He (subúŒnahu 
wa taÔŒlŒ ) would have such aquality.  His attributes are befitting to Him 
alone, and "There is nothing like unto Him." (42:11 )

5with before."  And it is given to them in likeness.  And they 
will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein 
eternally.
26.Indeed, AllŒh is not timid to present an example –that of a 
mosquito or what is smaller15than it.  And those who have 
believed know that it is the truth from their Lord.  But as for 
those who disbelieve, they say, "What did All Œh intend by this 
as an example?"  He misleads many thereby and gui des many 
thereby.  And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,
27.Who break the covenant of All Œh after contracting it and sever 
that which All Œh has ordered to be joined and cause corruption
on earth.  It is those who are the losers.
28.How can you disbelieve in AllŒh when you were lifeless and 
He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He 
will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be 
returned.
29.It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth.  
Then He directed Himself16to the heaven, [His being above 
all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing
of all things.
30.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when your Lord said to the angels,
"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authorit y."17  
They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption 
therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and 
sanctify You?"  He [AllŒh] said, "Indeed, I know that which 
you do not know."
31.And He taught Adam the names –all of them.  Then He 
showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names 
of these, if you are truthful."
32.They said, "Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except 
                                               
15Literally, "above it," i.e., greater in smallness.16See footnote to 2:19.17Khal¥fah :  successor, or generations of man, one following another.

6what You have taught us.  Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing,
the Wise."
33.He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names."  And when 
he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell 
you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth?   
And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."
34.And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before 
Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees.18  He refused and 
was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.
35.And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise 
and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from where ver you 
will.  But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the 
wrongdoers."
36.But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them 
from that [condition] in which they had been.  And We said, 
"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, andyou 
will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision 
for a time."
37.Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words,19and He 
accepted his repentance.  Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting 
of repentance, the Merciful.
38.We said, "Go down from it, all of you.  And when guidance 
comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance –there 
will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
39.And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs –those will be 
companions of the Fire; they will abide th erein eternally."
40.O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed
upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill 
your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.
                                               
18The proper name of Satan, who was not an angel but from the jinn, as 
stated in 18:50 .  Done in obedience to AllŒh, this prostration was one of 
respect, not worship.19AllŒh taught Adam words of repentance that would be acceptable to Him.

741.And believe in what I have sent down confirming tha t which is
[already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it.  And 
do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.
42.And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth 
while you know [it].
43.And establish prayer and give zakŒh20and bow with those 
who bow [in worship and obedience].
44.Do you order righteousness of the people and forget21yourselves
while you recite the Scripture?  Then will you not reason?
45.And seek help through patience and prayer; and indeed, itis 
difficult except for the humbly submissive [to All Œh]
46.Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they 
will return to Him.
47.O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed 
upon you and that I preferred you over the world s [i.e., peoples].
48.And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul22at all,
nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation
be taken from it, nor will they be aided.
49.And [recall] when We saved you [i.e., your forefathers] from 
the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, 
slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive.   
And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
50.And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and 
drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.
51.And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for 
forty nights.  Then you took [for worship] the calf after him 
[i.e., his departure], while you were wrongdoers.
                                               
20An annual expenditure for the benefit of the Isl Œmic community (see 9:60) 
required of those Muslims who have excess wealth.  Prayer and zakŒh are 
among the pillars of Isl Œm.21Make exceptions of.22i.e., fulfill what is due from it.

852.Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.
53.And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion23
that perhaps you would be guided.
54.And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, 
indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the cal f
[for worship].  So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves 
[i.e., the guilty among you].  That is best for [all of] you in the 
sight of your Creator."  Then He accepted your repentance; 
indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
55.And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe 
you until we see AllŒh outright"; so the thunderbolt took you 
while you were looking on.
56.Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would 
be grateful.
57.And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna 
and quails, [saying], "Eat from the good things with which We 
have provided you."  And they wronged Us not –but they 
were [only] wronging themselves.
58.And [recall] when We said, "Enter this city [i.e., Jerusalem] 
and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, 
and enter the gate bowing humbly24and say, 'Relieve us of our 
burdens [i.e., sins].'  We will [then] forgive your sins for you, 
and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward]."
59.But those w ho wronged changed [those words] to a statement 
other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down 
upon those who wronged a punishment [i.e., plague] from the 
sky because they were defiantly disobeying.
60.And [recall] when Moses prayed for wate r for his people, so 
We said, "Strike with your staff the stone."  And there gushed 
forth from it twelve springs, and every people [i.e., tribe] knew
                                               
23Differentiating between truth and falsehood.  "The Sc ripture and criterion" 
refers to the Torah.24In gratitude to All Œh and admission of sin.

9its watering place.  "Eat and drink from the provision of All Œh,
and do not commit abuse on the earth, spr eading corruption."
61.And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we can never endure 
one [kind of] food.  So call upon your Lord to bring forth for 
us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its 
garlic and its lentils and its onions."  [Moses] said, "Would 
you exchange what is better for what is less?  Go into [any] 
settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked."   
And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and 
returned with anger from All Œh [upon them].  That was because
they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of AllŒh and killed 
the prophets without right.  That was because they disobeyed 
and were [habitually] transgressing.
62.Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or 
Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Muúamm ad()] –
those [among them] who believed in AllŒh and the Last Day 
and did righteousness –will have their reward with their Lord, 
and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve .25
63.And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, 
to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, 
[saying], "Take what We have given you with determination and 
remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous."
64.Then you turned away after that.  And if not for the favor of 
AllŒh upon you and His mercy, you would have been among 
the losers.
65.And you had already known about those who transgressed 
among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, "Be 
apes, despised."
66.And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were 
present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for 
those who fear All Œh.
                                               
25After the coming of Prophet Muúammad ( ) no religion other than Isl Œm 
is acceptable to All Œh, as stated in 3:85.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
1067.And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "Indeed, AllŒh 
commands you to slaughter a cow."  They said, "Do you take 
us in ridicule?"  He said, "I seek refuge in AllŒh from being 
among the ignorant."
68.They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it 
is."  [Moses] said, "[All Œh] says, 'It is a cow which is neither 
old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are 
commanded."
69.They said, "Call upon your Lord to show us what is her 
color."  He said, "He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color –
pleasing to the observers. '"
70.They said, "Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.  
Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us.  And indeed we, if AllŒh 
wills, will be guided."
71.He said, "He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth 
nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon 
her.'"  They said, "Now you have come with the truth."  So 
they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.
72.And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed26over it, but 
AllŒh was to bring out that which you were concealing.
73.So We said, "Strike him [i.e., the slain man] with part of it."27  
Thus does All Œh bring the dead to life, a nd He shows you His 
signs that you might reason.
74.Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones 
or even harder.  For indeed, there are stones from which rivers 
burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and 
water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down 
for fear of All Œh.  And All Œh is not unaware of what you do.
75.Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe 
for you while a party of them used to hear the words of All Œh 
                                               
26i.e., exchanged accusations and denials.27i.e., the cow.  Thereupon, AllŒh restored life to the man, who informed 
them of his murderer.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
11and then distort it [i.e ., the Torah] after they had understood it 
while they were knowing?
76.And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We have 
believed"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, 
"Do you talk to them about what All Œh has revealed to you so 
they can argue with you about it before your Lord?"  Then 
will you not reason?
77.But do they not know that All Œh knows what they conceal and 
what they declare?
78.And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the 
Scripture except [indulgement in] wish ful thinking, but they 
are only assuming.
79.So woe28to those who write the "scripture" with their own 
hands, then say, "This is from AllŒh," in order to exchange it 
for a small price.  Woe to them for what their hands have 
written and woe to them for wha t they earn.
80.And they say, "Never will the Fire touch us, except for [a few] 
numbered days."  Say, "Have you taken a covenant with All Œh?  
For All Œh will never break His covenant.  Or do you say about 
AllŒh that which you do not know?"
81.Yes, [on thecontrary], whoever earns evil and his sin has 
encompassed him –those are the companions of the Fire; they 
will abide therein eternally.
82.But they who believe and do righteous deeds –those are the 
companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eterna lly.
83.And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of 
Israel, [enjoining upon them], "Do not worship except AllŒh; 
and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the 
needy.  And speak to people good [words] and establish 
prayer and gi ve zakŒh."  Then you turned away, except a few 
of you, and you were refusing.
                                               
28i.e., death and destruction.

Page 34:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
1284.And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], "Do not 
shed your [i.e., each other's] blood or evict one another from 
your homes."  Then you acknowledged [this] while youwere 
witnessing.
85.Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and
evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating 
against them in sin and aggression.  And if they come to you 
as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was 
forbidden to you.  So do you believe in part of the Scripture 
and disbelieve in part?  Then what is the recompense for those 
who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on 
the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the seve rest 
of punishment.  And All Œh is not unaware of what you do.
86.Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in 
exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be 
lightened for them, nor will they be aided.
87.And We did certainly give Moses the Scripture [i.e., the Torah]
and followed up after him with messengers.  And We gave 
Jesus , the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with 
the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel].  But is it [not] that 
every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], 
with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant?  And a
party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.
88.And they said, "Our hearts are wrapped."29  But, [in fact], 
AllŒh has cursed them for their disbeli ef, so little is it that they 
believe.
89.And when there came to them a Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] from 
AllŒh confirming that which was with them –although before 
they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved –
but [then] when there came to th em that which they recognized,
they disbelieved in it; so the curse of AllŒh will be upon the 
disbelievers.
                                               
29Covered or sealed against reception of All Œh's word.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
1390.How wretched is that for which they sold themselves –that 
they would disbelieve in what AllŒh has revealed through 
[their] outrage that AllŒh would send down His favor upon 
whom He wills from among His servants.  So they returned 
having [earned] wrath upon wrath.  And for the disbelievers is 
a humiliating punishment.
91.And when it is said to them, "Believe in what All Œh has revealed,"
they say, "We believe [only] in what was revealed to us."  
And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth 
confirming that which is with them.  Say, "Then why did you 
kill the prophets of All Œh before, if you are [indeed] believers?"
92.And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs.  Then you 
took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.
93.And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you 
the mount, [saying], "Take what We have given you with 
determination and listen."  They said [instead], "We hear and 
disobey."  And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf 
because of their disbelief.  Say, "How wretched is that which 
your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers."
94.Say, [O Muúammad ], "If the h ome of the Hereafter with All Œh 
is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for 
death, if you should be truthful."
95.But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands 
have put forth.  And All Œh is Knowing of the wrongdoers.
96.And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for 
life –[even] more than those who associate others with All Œh.  
One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand 
years, but it would not remove him in the least from the 
[coming] punishment that he should be granted life.  And 
AllŒh is Seeing of what they do.
97.Say, "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel –it is [none but] he 
who has brought it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] down upon your heart, [O 
Muúammad ], by permission of AllŒh, confirming that which 
was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers."

Page 36:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
1498.Whoever is an enemy to All Œh and His angels and His messengers
and Gabriel and Michael –then indeed, AllŒh is an enemy to 
the disbelievers.
99.And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] 
clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly 
disobedient.
100.Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of 
them threw it away?  But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.
101.And when a messen ger from AllŒh came to them confirming 
that which was with them, a party of those who had been given 
the Scripture threw the Scripture of AllŒh [i.e., the Torah] 
behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].
102.And they followed [instea d] what the devils had recited during
the reign of Solomon.  It was not Solomon who disbelieved, 
but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which
was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, HŒr´t and MŒr´t.  
But they [i.e., the two angels] d o not teach anyone unless they 
say, "We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic] ."30  
And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause 
separation between a man and his wife.  But they do not harm 
anyone through it except by permission of AllŒh.  And they 
[i.e., people] learn what harms them and does not benefit them.   
But they [i.e., the Children of Israel] certainly knew that whoever
purchased it [i.e., magic] would not have in the Hereafter any 
share.  And wretched is that for which t hey sold themselves, if 
they only knew.
103.And if they had believed and feared AllŒh, then the reward 
from All Œh would have been [far] better, if they only knew.
104.O you who have believed, say not [to AllŒh's Messenger], 
"RŒÔinŒ" but say, "UnthurnŒ"31and listen.  And for the 
                                               
30They warn people against the misuse of what they have learned.31The word "rŒÔin Œ" in Arabic literally means "consider us," i.e., give us 
time to hear you and listen to us.  The Jews used to use the same word
with the meaning of an insult.  Therefore, the believers were ordered to 

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
15disbelievers is a painful punishment.
105.Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture 
[i.e., the Jews and Christians] nor the polytheists wish that 
any good should be sent down to you from your Lord.  But 
AllŒh selects for His mercy whom He wills, and AllŒh is the 
possessor of great bounty.
106.We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except 
that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it.  Do you 
not know that All Œh is over all things co mpetent?
107.Do you not know that to AllŒh belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides AllŒh 
any protector or any helper?
108.Or do you intend to ask32your Messenger as Moses was asked 
before?  And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly
strayed from the soundness of the way.
109.Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you 
back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from 
themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them.  
So pardon and overlook until AllŒh delivers His command.  
Indeed, All Œh is over all things competent.
110.And establish prayer and give zakŒh, and whatever good you 
put forward for yourselves –you will find it with AllŒh.  
Indeed All Œh, of what you d o, is Seeing.
111.And they say, "None will enter Paradise except one who is a 
Jew or a Christian."  That is [merely] their wishful thinking.  
Say, "Produce your proof, if you should be truthful."
112.Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e. , self] in 
IslŒm to All Œh while being a doer of good will have his reward
with his Lord.  And no fear will there be concerning them, nor 
will they grieve.
                                                                      
avoid this expression and use instead the word " unthurnŒ, " i.e., "wait for 
us [so that we may understand]." 32i.e., persistently question or, as in the case of the disbelievers, demand a 
miracle of the Prophet ( ).

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
16113.The Jews say, "The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,"
and the Christians say, "The Jews have nothing to stand on," 
although they [both] recite the Scripture.  Thus do those who 
know not [i.e., the polytheists] speak the same as their words.  
But All Œh will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection
concerning that over which they used to differ.
114.And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of 
AllŒh from being mentioned [i.e., praised] in His mosques and 
strive toward their destruction.  It is not for them to enter them 
except in fear.  For them in this world is disgrace, and they 
will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.
115.And to All Œh belongs the east and the west.  So wherever you 
[might] turn, there is the Face33of AllŒh.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
all-Encompassing and Knowing.
116.They say, "All Œh has taken a son."  Ex alted is He!34  Rather, to 
Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.  All are 
devoutly obedient to Him,
117.Originator of the heavens and the earth.  When He decrees a 
matter, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
118.Those who do not know say, "Why does All Œh not speak to us 
or there come to us a sign?"  Thus spoke those before them 
like their words.  Their hearts resemble each other.  We have 
shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].
119.Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muúa mmad ], with the truth as 
a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be 
asked about the companions of Hellfire.
120.And never will the Jews and the Christians approve of you 
until you follow their religion.  Say, "Indeed, the guidance of 
AllŒh is the [only] guidance."  If you were to follow their 
desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would 
have against All Œh no protector or helper.

17121.Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true 
recital.35  They [are the ones w ho] believe in it.  And whoever 
disbelieves in it –it is they who are the losers.
122.O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have 
bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.
123.And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for anoth er soul36at 
all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any 
intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.
124.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Abraham was tried by 
his Lord with words [i.e., commands] and he fulfilled them.  
[AllŒh] said , "Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people."  
[Abraham] said, "And of my descendants?"  [All Œh] said, "My 
covenant does not include the wrongdoers ."
125.And [mention] when We made the House [i.e., the KaÔbah] a 
place of return for the people and [a place of] security.  And 
take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham a 
place of prayer.  And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, 
[saying], "Purify My House for those who perform ‹awŒf37
and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who 
bow and prostrate [in prayer]."
126.And [mention] when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this a 
secure city and provide its people with fruits –whoever of 
them believes in All Œh and the Last Day."  [All Œh] said, "And 
whoever disbelieves –I will grant him enjoyment for a little; 
then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and 
wretched is the destination."
127.And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of 
the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], "Our Lord, accept
[this] from us.  Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.
                                               
35i.e., applying its teachings to their lives.36See footnote to 2:48.37A form of worship particular to the KaÔbah consisting of going around it in 
circuits.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
18128.Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and 
from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You.  
And show us our rites [of úajj and Ôumrah] and accept our 
repentance.  Indeed, You are the Accept ing of repentance, the 
Merciful.
129.Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves
who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book 
and wisdom and purify them.  Indeed, You are the Exalted in 
Might, the Wise."
130.And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except 
one who makes a fool of himself.  And We had chosen him in 
this world, and indeed he, in the Hereafter, will be among the 
righteous.
131.When his Lord said to him, "Submit," he said, "I have submitted
[in Isl Œm]38to the Lord of the worlds."
132.And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did]
Jacob, [saying], "O my sons, indeed All Œh has chosen for you 
this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims."
133.Or were you witnesses when death app roached Jacob, when he 
said to his sons, "What will you worship after me?"  They said, 
"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, 
Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac –one God.39  And we are 
Muslims [in submission] to Him."
134.That was a nation whic h has passed on.  It will have [the 
consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you 
have earned.  And you will not be asked about what they used 
to do.
135.They say, "Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided."  
                                               
38The meaning of the word "IslŒm" is "submission to the will of AllŒh."  
This is the way of life ordai ned by All Œh and taught by all of the prophets 
from Adam to Muúammad ( ).  A Muslim is one who submits himself to 
AllŒh.39AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) alone.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 1
19Say, "Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining 
toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists."40
136.Say, [O believers], "We have believed in AllŒh and what has 
been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham 
and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendan ts 
[al-AsbŒ‹]41and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what 
was given to the prophets from their Lord.  We make no 
distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in 
submission] to Him."
137.So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they 
have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are 
only in dissension, and All Œh will be sufficient for you against 
them.  And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
138.[And say, "Ours is] the religion of AllŒh.  And who is better 
than AllŒh in [ordaining] religion?  And we are worshippers 
of Him."
139.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Do you argue with us about AllŒh 
while He is our Lord and your Lord?  For us are our deeds, 
and for you are your deeds.  And we are sincere [in deed and 
intention] to Him."
140.Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob 
and the Descendants were Jews or Christians?  Say, "Are you 
more knowing or is All Œh?"  And who is more unjust than one 
who conceals a testimony42he has from All Œh?  And All Œh is 
not unaware of what you do.
141.That is a nation which has passed on.  It will have [the 
consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you 
have earned.  And you will not be asked about what they used 
to do.
                                               
40Those who associate others with All Œh in worship.41The twelve tribes of Israel descended from Jacob.42Statements in previous scriptures attesting to the nature of All Œh's religion 
(IslŒm) and the coming of Prophet Muúammad ( ).

20142.The foolish among the people will say, "What has tur ned them 
away from their qiblah,43which they used to face?"44  Say, 
"To All Œh belongs the east and the west.  He guides whom He 
wills to a straight path."
143.And thus We have made you a median [i.e., just] community 
that you will be witnesses over the peo ple and the Messenger 
will be a witness over you.  And We did not make the qiblah 
which you used to face except that We might make evident 
who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back 
on his heels.  And indeed, it is difficult except for those w hom 
AllŒh has guided.  And never would All Œh have caused you to 
lose your faith [i.e., your previous prayers].  Indeed AllŒh is, 
to the people, Kind and Merciful.
144.We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O 
Muúammad ], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you 
to a qiblah with which you will be pleased.  So turn your face 
[i.e., yourself] toward al-Masjid al-îarŒm.45  And wherever 
you [believers] are, turn your faces [i.e., yourselves] toward it 
[in prayer].  Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture 
[i.e., the Jews and the Christians] well know that it is the truth 
from their Lord.  And All Œh is not unaware of what they do.
145.And if you brought to those who were given the Scripture 
every sign, they would not follow your qiblah.  Norwill you 
be a follower of their qiblah.  Nor would they be followers of 
one another's qiblah.  So if you were to follow their desires 
after what has come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would 
then be among the wrongdoers.
                                               
43The direction faced in prayer.44Prior to the command (in verse 144) that the Prophet () and his 
followers turn toward the KaÔbah in Makkah for prayer, they had been 
facing Jerusalem to the north .  The implications of this change are 
mentioned in succeeding verses.45The Sacred Mosque in Makkah containing the KaÔbah.

21146.Those to whom We gave the S cripture know him [i.e., Prophet 
Muúammad ()] as they know their own sons.  But indeed, a 
party of them conceal the truth while they know [it].
147.The truth is from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.
148.For each [religious following] is a [prayer] direction toward 
which it faces.  So race to [all that is] good.  Wherever you 
may be, All Œh will bring you forth [for judgement] all together.   
Indeed, All Œh is over all things competent.
149.So from wherever you go out [for prayer, O Muúammad ], 
turn your face toward al-Masjid al-îarŒm, and indeed, it is 
the truth from your Lord.  And AllŒh is not unaware of what 
you do.
150.And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face 
toward al -Masjid al -îarŒm.  And wherever you [believers] may
be, turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not 
have any argument against you, except for those of them who 
commit wrong; so fear them not but fear Me.  And [it is] so I 
may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided,
151.Just as We have sent among you a messenger from yourse lves
reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you 
the Book and wisdom46and teaching you that which you did 
not know.
152.So remember Me; I will remember you.  And be grateful to 
Me and do not deny Me.
153.O you who have believed, seek help through patience and 
prayer.  Indeed, All Œh is with the patient.
154.And do not say about those who are killed in the way of All Œh,
"They are dead."  Rather, they are alive, but you perceive [it] not.
155.And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger
and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings 
to the patient,
                                               
46The wisdom taught by the Prophet ( ) is his sunnah.

22156.Who, when disaster strikes them, say, "Indeed we belong to 
AllŒh, and indeed to Him we will return."
157.Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord 
and mercy.  And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.
158.Indeed, a§-êafŒ and al-Marwah are among the symbols47of 
AllŒh.  So whoever makes úajj [pilgrimage] to the House or 
performs Ôumrah –there is no blame upon him for walking 
between th em.48  And whoever volunteers good –then indeed,
AllŒh is Appreciative and Knowing.
159.Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs
and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the 
Scripture –those are cursed by All Œh and cursed by those who 
curse,49
160.Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make
evident [what they concealed].  Those –I will accept their 
repentance, and I am the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
161.Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are 
disbelievers –upon them will be the curse of All Œh and of the 
angels and the people, all together,
162.Abiding eternally therein.  The punishment will not be lightened 
for them, nor will they be reprieved.
163.And your god is one God.  There is no deity [wor thy of worship ] 
except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
164.Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the 
alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships 
which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, 
and what AllŒh has sent down from the heavens of rain, 
giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and 
dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] 
                                               
47Places designated for the rites of úajj and Ôumrah.48Some believers had previou sly feared that this might be a pagan practice, 
so All Œh confirms that saÔ¥ is among the rites of His religion.49From among the angels and the believers.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
23directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the 
heaven and earth are signs for a people who use reason.
165.And [yet], among the people are those who take other than 
AllŒh as equals [to Him].  They love them as they [should] 
love AllŒh.  But those who believe are stronger in love for AllŒh.  
And i f only they who have wronged would consider [that] when
they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power 
belongs to All Œh and that All Œh is severe in punishment.
166.[And they should consider that] when those who have been 
followed disassoci ate themselves from those who followed 
[them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from 
them are the ties [of relationship],
167.Those who followed will say, "If only we had another turn [at 
worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as 
they have disassociated themselves from us."  Thus will All Œh
show them their deeds as regrets upon them.  And they are 
never to emerge from the Fire.
168.O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and 
good and do not follow the fo otsteps of Satan.  Indeed, he is to 
you a clear enemy.
169.He only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about 
AllŒh what you do not know.
170.And when it is said to them, "Follow what All Œh has revealed,"
they say, "Rather, we will follow that which we found our
fathers doing."  Even though their fathers understood nothing,
nor were they guided?
171.The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who 
shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries [i.e., cattle or 
sheep] –deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.
172.O you who have believed, eat from the good [i.e., lawful] 
things which We have provided for you and be grateful to 
AllŒh if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
24173.He has only forbidden to you dead animals,50blood, the flesh 
of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than 
AllŒh.  But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring 
[it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him.  
Indeed , AllŒh is Forgiving and Merciful.
174.Indeed, they who conceal what AllŒh has sent down of the 
Book and exchange it for a small price –those consume not 
into their bellies except the Fire.  And All Œh will not speak to 
them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them.  
And they will have a painful pu nishment.
175.Those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error 
and forgiveness for punishment.  How patient they are for 
[i.e., in pursuit of] the Fire!
176.That is [deserved by them] because AllŒh has sent down the 
Book in truth.  And indeed, those who differ over the Book 
are in extreme dissension.
177.Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east 
or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes 
in All Œh, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets 
and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, 
the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for 
freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zakŒh; 
[those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and 
[those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during 
battle.  Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those 
who are the righteous.
178.O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution
for those murdered –the free for the free, the slave for t he slave, 
and the female for the female.51  But whoever overlooks from 
his brother [i.e., the killer] anything,52then there should be a 
suitable follow -up and payment to him [i.e., the deceased's 
                                               
50Those not slaughtered or hunted expressly for food.51No one else should be executed in place of the k iller.52By accepting compensation payment rather than execution.

25heir or legal representative] with good conduct.  This is an 
alleviation from your Lord and a mercy.  But whoever 
transgresses after that53will have a painful punishment.
179.And there is for you in legal retribution [saving of] life, O you
[people] of understanding, that you may become righteous.
180.Prescribed f or you when death approaches [any] one of you if 
he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the 
parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable –a 
duty upon the righteous.54
181.Then whoever alters it [i.e., the bequest] after he h as heard it –
the sin is only upon those who have altered it.  Indeed, AllŒh 
is Hearing and Knowing.
182.But if one fears from the bequeather [some] error or sin and 
corrects that which is between them [i.e., the concerned parties],
there is no sin upon him.  Indeed, AllŒh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
183.O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it 
was decreed upon those before you that you may become 
righteous –
184.[Fasting for] a limited number of days.  So whoever among 
you is ill or on a journey [during them] –then an equal 
number of days [are to be made up].  And upon those who are 
able [to fast, but with hardship] –a ransom [as substitute] of 
feeding a poor person [each day].  And whoever volunteers
good [i.e., excess] –it is better for him.  But to fast is best for 
you, if you only knew.
185.The month of Rama dhŒn [is that] in which was revealed the 
QurÕŒn, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance
and criterion.  So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month ,55
                                               
53After acceptance of compensation.54This ruling was abrogated by the revelation in S´rah an-NisŒÕ stipulating 
obligatory shares for parents and close relatives.  Those who do not inherit 
by law may be remembered in a bequest .  See 4:11-12.55Also, "whoever is present during the month."

Page 48:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
26let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey –then an 
equal number of other days.  AllŒh intends for you ease and 
does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to 
complete the period and to glorify All Œh for that [to] which He 
has guided you; and pe rhaps you will be grateful.
186.And when My servants ask you, [O Muúammad ], concerning 
Me –indeed I am near.  I respond to the invocation of the 
supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me 
[by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] 
guided.
187.It has been made permissible for you the night preceding 
fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations].  They are 
clothing for you and you are clothing for them.  All Œh knows 
that you used to deceive yourselves,56so He accepte d your 
repentance and forgave you.  So now, have relations with 
them and seek that which AllŒh has decreed for you [i.e., 
offspring].  And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn 
becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night].  
Then complete the fast until the night [i.e., sunset].  And do 
not have relations with them as long as you are staying for 
worship in the mosques.  These are the limits [set by] AllŒh, 
so do not approach them.  Thus does AllŒh make clear His 
verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that they may become 
righteous.
188.And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it 
[in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you 
[to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, 
while you know [it is un lawful].
189.They ask you, [O Muúammad ], about the new moons.  Say, 
"They are measurements of time for the people and for úajj 
[pilgrimage]."   And it is not righteousness to enter houses 
                                               
56Prior to this revelation, marital relations were unlawful during nights 
preceding fasting.  Some were unable to refrain and secretly disobeyed, 
but they did not deceive All Œh.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
27from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears AllŒh.  
And enter houses from their doors.  And fear AllŒh that you 
may succeed.
190.Fight in the way of AllŒh those who fight you but do not 
transgress.  Indeed, All Œh does not like transgressors.
191.And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them 
from wher ever they have expelled you, and fitnah57is worse 
than killing.  And do not fight them at al-Masjid al-îarŒm 
until they fight you there.  But if they fight you, then kill them.   
Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.
192.And if they cease, then indee d, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
193.Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah58and [until] religion
[i.e., worship] is [acknowledged to be] for AllŒh.  But if they 
cease, then there is to be no aggression [i.e., assault] except 
against the oppressors .
194.[Fighting in] the sacred month is for [aggression committed in]
the sacred month,59and for [all] violations is legal retribution.   
So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same 
way that he has assaulted you.  And fear All Œh and know tha t 
AllŒh is with those who fear Him.
195.And spend in the way of All Œh and do not throw [yourselves] 
with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining].  And 
do good; indeed, All Œh loves the doers of good.
196.And complete the úajj and Ôumrah for AllŒh.  But if you are 
prevented, then [offer] what can be obtained with ease of 
sacrificial animals.  And do not shave your heads until the 
sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter.  And 
whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head 
[mak ing shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting 
                                               
57Disbelief and its imposition on others.58Among the meanings of fitnah are disbelief, discord, dissension, civil 
strife, persecution, oppression, injustice, seduction, trial and torment.59The sacred months are Dhul -QaÔdah, Dhul -îijjah, Muúa rram and Rajab.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
28[three days] or charity60or sacrifice.61  And when you are 
secure,62then whoever performs Ôumrah [during the úajj 
months]63followed by úajj [offers] what can be obtained with 
ease of sacrificial animals.   And whoever cannot find [or 
afford such an animal] –then a fast of three days during úajj 
and of seven when you have returned [home].  Those are ten 
complete [days].  This is for those whose family is not in the 
area of al-Masjid al-îarŒm.  And fear AllŒh and know that 
AllŒh is severe in penalty.
197.îajj is [during] well-known months,64so whoever has made 
úajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of 
iúrŒm], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no 
disobedience and no disput ing during úajj.  And whatever 
good you do –AllŒh knows it.  And take provisions, but indeed,
the best provision is fear of AllŒh.  And fear Me, O you of 
understanding.
198.There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty65from your 
Lord [during úajj].  Butwhen you depart from ÔArafŒt, remember
AllŒh at al-Mash Ôar al-îarŒm.66  And remember Him, as He 
has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those 
astray.
199.Then depart from the place from where [all] the people depart 
and ask forgiveness of AllŒh.  Indeed, AllŒh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
200.And when you have completed your rites, remember AllŒh 
like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with 
[much] greater remembrance.  And among the people is he  
                                               
60Feeding six needy persons.61The slaughter of a sheep or goat.62Under normal conditions, i.e., are not prevented.63The months of ShawwŒl, Dhul -QaÔdah and Dhul -îijjah.64See previous footnote.65i.e., profit from trade or business.66Which is i n Muzdalifah.

29who says, "Our Lord, give us in thi s world," and he will have 
in the Hereafter no share.
201.But among them is he who says, "Our Lord, give us in this 
world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is]
good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire."
202.Those will have a share of what they have earned, and All Œh is 
swift in account.
203.And remember AllŒh during [specific] numbered days.  Then 
whoever hastens [his departure] in two days –there is no sin 
upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] –there is no 
sin u pon him –for him who fears All Œh.  And fear All Œh and 
know that unto Him you will be gathered.
204.And of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly 
life, and he calls All Œh to witness as to what is in his heart, yet 
he is the fiercest of oppon ents.
205.And when he goes away, he strives throughout the land to cause
corruption therein and destroy crops and animals.  And AllŒh 
does not like corruption.
206.And when it is said to him, "Fear All Œh," pride in the sin takes
hold of him.  Sufficient for him is Hellfire, and how wretched 
is the resting place.
207.And of the people is he who sells himself, seeking means to 
the approval of All Œh.  And All Œh is Kind to [His] servants.
208.O you who have believed, enter into IslŒm completely [and 
perfect ly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan.  Indeed, he 
is to you a clear enemy.
209.But if you slip [i.e., deviate] after clear proofs have come to 
you, then know that All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
210.Do they await but that All Œh should come to them in covers of 
clouds and the angels [as well] and the matter is [then] decided?   
And to All Œh [all] matters are returned.
211.Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We 
have given them.  And whoever exchanges the favor of All Œh 

Page 52:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
30[for di sbelief] after it has come to him –then indeed, All Œh is 
severe in penalty.
212.Beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world, 
and they ridicule those who believe.  But those who fear All Œh
are above them on the Day of Resurrection.  And AllŒh gives 
provision to whom He wills without account.
213.Mankind was [of] one religion [before their deviation]; then 
AllŒh sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners 
and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge 
between the people concerning that in which they differed.  
And none differed over it [i.e., the Scripture] except those 
who were given it –after the clear proofs came to them –out 
of jealous animosity among themselves.  And AllŒh guided
those who believed to the trut h concerning that over which they
had differed, by His permission.  And All Œh guides whom He 
wills to a straight path.
214.Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] 
has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on 
before you?  They were touched by poverty and hardship and 
were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who 
believed with him said, "When is the help of AllŒh?"  
Unquestionably, the help of All Œh is near.
215.They ask you, [O Muúammad ], what they should spend.  Say, 
"Whatever you spend of good is [to be] for parents and 
relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler.  And 
whatever you do of good –indeed, All Œh is Knowing of it."
216.Fighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you.  
But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and 
perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you.  And AllŒh 
knows, while you know not.
217.They ask you about the sacred month67–about fighting 
therein.  Say, "Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting 
                                               
67See footnote to 2:194 .

Page 53:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
31[people] from the way of AllŒh and disbelief in Him and 
[preventing access to] al-Masjid al-îarŒm and the expulsion 
of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of All Œh.  
And fitnah68is greater than killing."  And they will continue to 
fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they 
are able.  And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to 
disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever –for those, their 
deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, 
and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide 
therein eternally.
218.Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated
and fought in the cause of AllŒh –those expect the mercy of 
AllŒh.  And All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
219.They ask you about wine69and gambling.  Say, "In them is 
great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people.  But their sin is 
greater than their benefit."  And they ask you what they should
spend.  Say, "The excess [beyond needs]."  Thus All Œh makes 
clear to you the verses [of r evelation] that you might give thought
220.To this world and the Hereafter.  And they ask you about 
orphans.  Say, "Improvement for them is best.  And if you mix
your affairs with theirs –they are your brothers.  And AllŒh
knows the corrupter from the am ender.  And if All Œh had willed, 
He could have put you in difficulty.  Indeed, All Œh is Exalted 
in Might and Wise."
221.And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe.70  
And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist, even 
though she migh t please you.  And do not marry polytheistic 
men [to your women] until they believe.  And a believing slave
is better than a polytheist, even though he might please you.  
Those invite [you] to the Fire, but AllŒh invites to Paradise 
and to forgiveness, by His permission.  And He makes clear 
                                               
68See footnote to 2:193 .69The word " khamr " (wine) includes all intoxicants.  The final prohibition is 
given in 5:90-91.70i.e., worship and obey All Œh alone.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
32His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that perhaps they 
may remember.
222.And they ask you about menstruation.  Say, "It is harm, so 
keep away from wives71during menstruation.  And do not 
approach them until they are pure.  And when they have 
purified themselves,72then come to them from where AllŒh 
has ordained for you.  Indeed, AllŒh loves those who are 
constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves."
223.Your wives are a place of cultivation [i.e., s owing of seed] for 
you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish 
and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves.  And fear AllŒh 
and know that you will meet Him.  And give good tidings to 
the believers.
224.And do not make [your oath by] All Œh an excuse against being 
righteous and fearing All Œh and making peace among people.  
And All Œh is Hearing and Knowing.
225.AllŒh does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional 
in your oaths, but He imposes blame upon you for what your 
hearts have earned.  And All Œh is Forgiving and Forbearing.
226.For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their 
wives73is a waiting time of four months, but if they return [to 
normal relations] –then indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
227.And if they decide on divorce –then indeed, All Œh is Hearing 
and Knowing.
228.Divorced women remain in waiting [i.e., do not remarry] for 
three periods,74and it is not lawful for them to conceal what 
AllŒh has created in their wombs if they believe in AllŒh and
                                               
71i.e., refrain from sexual intercourse.72By taking a complete bath ( ghusl ).73Without divorcing them.  By such an oath the woman is deprived of her 
right in marriage but is not free to marry another.  She may not be kept in 
such a condition beyond the four -month limit.74Either menstrual periods or periods of purity between menstruation.  See 
also 65:1-7.

33the Last Day.  And their husbands have more right to take 
them back in this [period] if they want reconciliation.75  And 
due to them [i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected of 
them, according to what is reasonable.76  But the men [i.e., 
husbands] have a degree over them [in responsibility and 
authority].  And All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
229.Divorce is twice.  Then [after that], either keep [her] in an 
acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment.  And 
it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have 
given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep 
[within] the limits of All Œh.77  But if you fear that they will not 
keep [within] the limits of All Œh, then there is no blame upon 
either of them concerning that bywhich she ransoms herself.  
These are the limits of All Œh, so do not transgress them.  And 
whoever transgresses the limits of AllŒh –it is those who are 
the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].
230.And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not 
lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband 
other than him.78  And if he [i.e., the latter husband] divorces 
her [or dies], there is no blame upon them [i.e., the woman 
and her former husband] for returning to each other if they 
think that they can keep [within] the limits of AllŒh.  These 
are the limits of All Œh, which He makes clear to a people who 
know [i.e., understand].
231.And when you divorce women and they have [nearly] fulfilled
their term, either retain them according to accept able terms or 
release them according to acceptable terms, and do not keep 
them, intending harm, to transgress [against them].  And whoever
                                               
75The husband may return her to himself during the Ôiddah period of a first 
and second divorce without a new marriage contract.76The wife has specific rights upon her husband, just as the husband has 
rights upon her.77i.e., deal fairly with each other.78With the intention of permanence, not merely in order to return to the 
previous husband.

34does that has certainly wronged himself.  And do not take the 
verses of AllŒh in jest.  And remember the favor of AllŒh 
upon you and what has been revealed to you of the Book [i.e., 
the QurÕŒn] and wisdom [i.e., the Prophet's sunnah] by which 
He instructs you.  And fear AllŒh and know that AllŒh is 
Knowing of all things.
232.And when you divorce women79and they have fulfilled their 
term, do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] 
husbands if they [i.e., all parties] agree among themselves on an
acceptable basis.  That is instructed to whoever of you believes
in AllŒh and the Last Day.  That is better for you and purer, 
and All Œh knows and you know not.
233.Mothers may nurse [i.e., breastfeed] their children two complete
years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period].  
Upon the father is their [i.e., the mothers'] provision and their 
clothing according to what is acceptable.  No person is charged
with more than his capacity.  No mother should be harmed 
through her child, and no father through his child.  And upon 
the [father's] heir is [a duty] like that [of the father].  And if 
they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of
them and consultation, there is no blame upon either of them.   
And if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute, 
there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment 
according to what is acceptable.  And fear AllŒh and know 
that All Œh is Seeing of what you do.
234.And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives 
behind –they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten 
[days].  And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is 
no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an 
acceptable manner.80  And AllŒh is [fully] Acquainted with 
what you do.
                                               
79For the first or second time.80They may remarry if they wish.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 2
35235.There is no blame upon you for that to which you [indirectly] 
allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you 
conceal within yourse lves.  AllŒh knows that you will have 
them in mind.  But do not promise them secretly except for 
saying a proper saying.  And do not determine to undertake a 
marriage contract until the decreed period81reaches its end.  
And know that All Œh knows what is wi thin yourselves, so beware 
of Him.  And know that All Œh is Forgiving and Forbearing.
236.There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have 
not touched82nor specified for them an obligation.83  But give 
them [a gift of] compensation –the wealthy according to his 
capability and the poor according to his capability –a provision
according to what is acceptable, a duty upon the doers of good.
237.And if you divorce them before you have touched them and 
you have already specified for them an obligation, then [give] 
half of what you specified –unless they forego the right or the 
one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it.  And 
to forego it is nearer to righteousness.  And do not forget 
graciousness between you.  Indeed All Œh, of whatever you do,
is Seeing.
238.Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] 
the middle [i.e., Ôa§r] prayer and stand before AllŒh, devoutly 
obedient.
239.And if you fear [an enemy, then pray] on foot or riding.  But 
when you are secure, then remem ber AllŒh [in prayer], as He 
has taught you that which you did not [previously] know.
240.And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives 
behind –for their wives is a bequest:  maintenance for one 
year without turning [them] out.  But if they leave [of their 
own accord], then there is no blame upon you for what they 
                                               
81The Ôiddah (bereavement period) after the death of a husband.82The m arriage has not been consummated.83Required bridal gift ( mahr ).

36do with themselves in an acceptable way.84  And AllŒh is 
Exalted in Might and Wise.
241.And for divorced women is a provision according to what is 
acceptable –a duty upon the right eous.
242.Thus does All Œh make clear to you His verses [i.e., laws] that 
you might use reason.
243.Have you not considered those who left their homes in many 
thousands, fearing death?  All Œh said to them, "Die"; then He 
restored them to life.  And All Œh is full of bounty to the people,
but most of the people do not show gratitude.
244.And fight in the cause of AllŒh and know that AllŒh is 
Hearing and Knowing.
245.Who is it that would loan AllŒh a goodly loan so He may 
multiply it for him many times over?  And it is All Œh who 
withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be 
returned.
246.Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel
after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs,
"Send to us a king, and we will fig ht in the way of All Œh"?  He 
said, "Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if fighting was 
prescribed for you?"  They said, "And why should we not 
fight in the cause of All Œh when we have been driven out from 
our homes and from our children?"  But when fighting was 
prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them.   
And All Œh is Knowing of the wrongdoers.
247.And their prophet said to them, "Indeed, All Œh has sent to you 
Saul as a king."  They said, "How can he have kingship over 
us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has 
not been given any measure of wealth?"  He said, "Indeed, 
AllŒh has chosen him over you and has increased him 
abundantly in knowledge and stature.  And AllŒh gives His
sovereignty to whom He wills.  And All Œh is all-Encompassing
[in favor] andKnowing."
                                               
84This directive was abrogated by those later revealed in 2:234  and 4:12.

Page 59:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
37248.And their prophet said to them, "Indeed, a sign of his kingship
is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance85from 
your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses andthe 
family of Aaron had left, carried by the angels.  Indeed in that 
is a sign for you, if you are believers."
249.And when Saul went forth with the soldiers, he said, "Indeed, 
AllŒh will be testing you with a river.  So whoever drinks from
it is not of me, and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me, 
excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand."  
But they drank from it, except a [very] few of them.  Then when
he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, 
they said, "There is no power for us toda y against Goliath and
his soldiers."  But those who were certain that they would 
meet AllŒh said, "How many a small company has overcome 
a large company by permission of AllŒh.  And AllŒh is with 
the patient."
250.And when they went forth to [face] Goliat h and his soldiers, 
they said, "Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly 
our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
251.So they defeated them by permission of AllŒh, and David 
killed Goliath, and AllŒh gave him the kingship and wisdom 
[i.e., prophethood] and taught him from that which He willed.   
And if it were not for All Œh checking [some] people by means
of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but AllŒh is 
full of bounty to the worlds.
252.These are the verses of AllŒh which We recite to you, [O 
Muúammad ], in truth.  And indeed, you are from among the 
messengers.
253.Those messengers –some of them We caused to exceed others.   
Among them were those to whom All Œh spoke, and He raised 
some of them in degree.  And We gave Jesus,the son of Mary,
clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., 
                                               
85Signs giving reassurance.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
38Gabriel].  If AllŒh had willed, those [generations] succeeding 
them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs 
had come to them.  But they differed, and some of them believed
and some of them disbelieved.  And if All Œh had willed, they 
would not have fought each other, but AllŒh does what He 
intends.
254.O you who have believed, spend from that which We have 
provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is 
no exchange [i.e., ransom] and no friendship and no intercession.   
And the disbelievers –they are the wrongdoers.
255.AllŒh –there is no deity except Him, the Ever -Living, the 
Sustainer of [all] existence.  Neither drowsiness overtakes 
Him nor sleep.  To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is on the earth.  Who is it that can intercede 
with Him except by His permission?  He knows what is 
[presently] before them and what will be after them,86and 
they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what 
He wills.  His Kurs¥87extends over the heavens and the earth, 
and their preservation tires Him not.  And He is the Most High,
the Most Great.
256.There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.  
The right course has become clear from the wrong.  So 
whoever disbelieves in ‹Œgh´t88and believes in AllŒh has 
grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it.  
And All Œh is Hearing and Knowing.
257.AllŒh is the ally89of those who believe.  He brings them out 
from darknesses into the light.  And those who disbelieve –
their allies are ‹Œgh´t.  They take them out of the light into 
                                               
86AllŒh's knowledge encompasses every aspect of His creations in the past, 
present and future .87Chair or footstool.  It is not to be confused with al-ÔArsh (the Throne), 
which is infinitely higher and greater than al-Kurs¥.88False objects of worship, such as idols, heavenly bodies, spirits, human 
beings, etc.89i.e., patron and supporter.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
39darknesses.90  Those are the companions of the Fire; they will 
abide eternally therein.
258.Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham 
about his Lord [merely] because All Œh had given him kingship?   
When Abraham said, "My Lord is the one who gives life and 
causes death," he said, "I give life and cause death."  Abraham
said, "Indeed, AllŒh brings up the sun from the east, so bring 
it up from the west."  So the disbeliever was overwhelmed 
[by astonishment], and AllŒh does not guide the wrongdoing 
people.
259.Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a 
township which had fallen into ruin.  He said, "How will 
AllŒh bring this to life after its death?"  So AllŒh caused him 
to die for a hundred years; then He revived him.  He said, 
"How long have you remained?"  He [the man] said, "I have 
remained a day or part of a day."  He said, "Rather, you have 
remained one hundred y ears.  Look at your food and your drink;
it has not changed with time.  And look at your donkey; and 
We will make you a sign for the people.  And look at the bones
[of this donkey] –how We raise them and then We cover 
them with flesh."  And when it became clear to him, he said, 
"I know that All Œh is over all things competent."
260.And [mention] when Abraham said, "My Lord, show me how 
You give life to the dead."  [AllŒh] said, "Have you not 
believed?"   He said, "Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may 
be satisfied."  [All Œh] said, "Take four birds and commit them
to yourself.91  Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a
portion of them; then call them –they will come [flying] to you
in haste.  And know that All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise."
261.The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of 
AllŒh is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in 
                                               
90The ligh t of truth is one, while the darknesses of disbelief, doubt and error 
are many.91i.e., train them to come to you on command.

Page 62:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
40each spike is a hundred grains.  And AllŒh multiplies [His 
reward] for whom He wills.  And AllŒh is all -Encompassing 
and Knowing.
262.Those who spend their wealth in the way of AllŒh and then 
do not follow up what they have spent with reminders [of it] 
or [other] injury will have their reward with their Lord, and 
there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
263.Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed 
by injury.  And All Œh is Free of need and Forbearing.
264.O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities 
with reminders [of it] or injury as does one who spends his 
wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in 
AllŒh and the Last Day.  His example is like that of a [large] 
smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour 
that leaves it bare.  They are unable [to keep] anything of what
they have earned.  And AllŒh does not guide the disbelieving 
people.
265.And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking 
means to the approval of AllŒh and assuring [reward for] 
themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a 
downpour –so it yields its fruits in doub le.  And [even] if it 
is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle [is sufficient].  And 
AllŒh, of what you do, is Seeing.
266.Would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and 
grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from 
every fruit? But he is afflicted with old age and has weak [i.e.,
immature] offspring, and it is hit by a whirlwind containing 
fire and is burned.  Thus does AllŒh make clear to you [His] 
verses that you might give thought.
267.O you who have believed, spend from thegood things which 
you have earned and from that which We have produced for 
you from the earth.  And do not aim toward the defective 
therefrom, spending [from that] while you would not take it 
[yourself] except with closed eyes.  And know that AllŒh is 
Free of need and Praiseworthy.

41268.Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality,
while AllŒh promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty.  
And All Œh is all -Encompassing and Knowing.
269.He gives wisdom92to whom He wills, and whoever has be en 
given wisdom has certainly been given much good.  And none
will remember except those of understanding.
270.And whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows –
indeed, AllŒh knows of it.  And for the wrongdoers there are 
no helpers.
271.If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; 
but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better 
for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds
[thereby].  And All Œh, with what you do, is [fully] Acquainted.
272.Not upon you, [O Muúammad ], is [responsibility for] their 
guidance, but All Œh guides whom He wills.  And whatever good
you [believers] spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend 
except seeking the countenance of AllŒh.  And whatever you 
spend of good93–it will be fully repaid to you, and you will 
not be wronged.
273.[Charity is] for the poor who have been restricted for the cause
of All Œh, unable to move about in the land.  An ignorant [person]
would think them self -sufficient because of their restraint, but 
you will know them by their [characteristic] sign.  They do 
not ask people persistently [or at all].  And whatever you 
spend of good –indeed, All Œh is Knowing of it.
274.Those who spend their wealth [in AllŒh's way] by night and 
by day, secretly and publicly –they will have their reward 
with their Lord.  And no fear will there be concerning them, 
nor will they grieve.
275.Those who consume interest94cannot stand [on the Day of 
                                               
92The knowledge and understanding of the religion and of the QurÕ Œn.93i.e., wealth, property, resources, time, effort, etc.94Include d is that given on commercial as well as consumer loans.

S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
42Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by 
Satan into insanity.  Th at is because they say, "Trade is [just] 
like interest."  But All Œh has permitted trade and has forbidden
interest.  So whoever has received an admonition from his 
Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests 
with AllŒh.  But whoever return s [to dealing in interest or 
usury] –those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide 
eternally therein.
276.AllŒh destroys interest and gives increase for charities.  And 
AllŒh does not like every sinning disbeliever.
277.Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish
prayer and give zakŒh will have their reward with their Lord, 
and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
278.O you who have believed, fear All Œh and give up what remains
[due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.
279.And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from 
AllŒh and His Messenger.  But if you repent, you may have 
your principal –[thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.
280.And if someone is in hardship, th en [let there be] postponement
until [a time of] ease.  But if you give [from your right as] charity,
then it is better for you, if you only knew.
281.And fear a Day when you will be returned to AllŒh.  Then 
every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they 
will not be wronged [i.e., treated unjustly].
282.O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a 
specified term, write it down.  And let a scribe write [it] 
between you in justice.  Let no scribe refuse to write as All Œh 
has taught h im.  So let him write and let the one who has the 
obligation [i.e., the debtor] dictate.  And let him fear AllŒh, 
his Lord, and not leave anything out of it.  But if the one who 
has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable
to dictate hi mself, then let his guardian dictate in justice.  And 
bring to witness two witnesses from among your men.  And if 
there are not two men [available], then a man and two women 

Page 65:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
43from those whom you accept as witnesses –so that if one of 
them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other can remind her.  
And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon.  
And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or 
large, for its [specified] term.  That is more just in the sight of 
AllŒh and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent 
doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction
which you conduct among yourselves.  For [then] there is no 
blame upon you if you do not write it.  And take witnesses 
when you conclude a contract.  Let no scrib e be harmed or any
witness.  For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in 
you.  And fear AllŒh.  And AllŒh teaches you.  And AllŒh is 
Knowing of all things.
283.And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a 
security deposit [shou ld be] taken.  And if one of you entrusts 
another, then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust 
[faithfully] and let him fear AllŒh, his Lord.  And do not 
conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it –his heart is 
indeed sinful, and All Œh is Knowing of what you do.
284.To AllŒh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is 
in the earth.  Whether you show what is within yourselves or 
conceal it, AllŒh will bring you to account for it.  Then He 
will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and 
AllŒh is over all things competent.
285.The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from 
his Lord, and [so have] the believers.  All of them have 
believed in AllŒh and His angels and His books and His 
messengers, [saying], "We make no distinc tion between any 
of His messengers."  And they say, "We hear and we obey.  
[We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final]
destination."
286.AllŒh does not charge a soul except [with that within] its 
capacity.  It will have [the consequenc e of] what [good] it has 
gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has 
earned.  "Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have 

Page 66:
S´rah 2–al-Baqarah JuzÕ 3
44forgotten or erred.  Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden 
like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and 
burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear.  And 
pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us.  You are 
our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people ."95
                                               
95AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ) concludes this s´rah by directing His servants
how to supplicate Him, just as He taught them in S´rah al -FŒtiúah how to 
praise Him and ask for guidance.

interpretation or whose meaning is known only to AllŒh, such as the 
opening letters of certain s´rahs.

469.Our Lord, surely You will gather the people for a Day about which
there is no doubt.  Indeed, All Œh does not fail in His promise."
10.Indeed, those who disbelieve –never will their wealth or their 
children avail them against AllŒh at all.  And it is they who 
are fuel for the Fire.
11.[Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and those 
before them.  They denied Our signs, so All Œh seized them for 
their sins.  And All Œh is severe in penalty.
12.Say to those who disbelieve, "You will be overcome and gathered
together to Hell, and wretched is the resting place."
13.Already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which 
met [in combat at Badr] –one fighting in the cause of AllŒh 
and another of disbelievers.  They saw them [to be] twice their 
[own] number by [their] eyesight.99  But AllŒh supports with 
His victory whom He wills.  Indeed in that is a lesson for 
those of vision.
14.Beautified for people is the love of that which t hey desire –of 
women and sons, heaped -up sums of gold and silver, fine 
branded horses, and cattle and tilled land.  That is the 
enjoyment of worldly life, but AllŒh has with Him the best 
return [i.e., Paradise].
15.Say, "Shall I inform you of [something] better than that?  For 
those who fear AllŒh will be gardens in the presence of their 
Lord beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, 
and purified spouses and approval from AllŒh.  And AllŒh is 
Seeing [i.e., aware] of [His] servants –
16.Those who say, "Our Lord, indeed we have believed, so forgive
us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire,"
17.The patient, the true, the obedient, those who spend [in the 
way of All Œh], and those who seek forgiveness before dawn.
                                               
99The believers saw the disbelievers to be double their own number preceding
the battle of Badr, while, in fact, they were three times their number.

4718.AllŒh witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] 
the angels and those of knowledge –[that He is] maintaining 
[creation] in justice.  There is no deity except Him, the Exalted
in Might, the Wise.
19.Indeed, the religion in the sight of All Œh is Isl Œm.  And those who
were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge 
had come to them –out of jealous animosity between themselves.   
And whoever disbelieves in the verses of AllŒh, then indeed, 
AllŒh is swift in [taking] account.
20.So if they argue with you, say, "I have submitted myself to AllŒh
[in IslŒm], and [so have] those who follow me."  And say to 
those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned,100
"Have you submitted yourselves?"  And if they submit [in Isl Œm],
they are right ly guided; but if they turn away –then upon you 
is only the [duty of] notification.  And All Œh is Seeing of [His] 
servants.
21.Those who disbelieve in the signs of All Œh and kill the prophets 
without right and kill those who order justice from among the 
people –give them tidings of a painful punishment.
22.They are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this 
world and the Hereafter, and for them there will be no helpers.
23.Do you not consider, [O Muúammad ], those who were given a 
portion of theScripture?  They are invited to the Scripture of 
AllŒh that it should arbitrate between them;101then a party of 
them turns away, and they are refusing.
24.That is because they say, "Never will the Fire touch us except 
for [a few] numbered days," and [beca use] they were deluded 
in their religion by what they were inventing.
25.So how will it be when We assemble them for a Day about 
                                               
100Those who had no scripture (i.e., the pagans).101Referring to the Jews of Mad¥nah who refused to implement the rulings 
given by AllŒh in the Torah or to acknowledge the Prophet (), whose 
coming was mentioned therein.

48which there is no doubt?  And each soul will be compensated 
[in full for] what it earned, and they will not be wronged.
26.Say, "O All Œh, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to
whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom 
You will.  You honor whom You will and You humble whom 
You will.  In Your hand102is [all] good.  Indeed, You are over 
all things competent.
27.You cause the night to enter the day, and You cause the day to 
enter the night; and You bring the living out of the dead, and 
You bring the dead out of the living.  And You give provision 
to whom You will without account [i.e., limit or measure]."
28.Let not believers take disbelievers as allies [i.e., supporters or 
protectors] rather than believers.  And whoever [of you] does 
that has nothing [i.e., no association] with All Œh, except when 
taking precaution against them in prudence.103  And AllŒh 
warns you o f Himself, and to All Œh is the [final] destination.
29.Say, "Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it, 
AllŒh knows it.  And He knows that which is in the heavens and
that which is on the earth.  And All Œh is over all things competent.
30.The Day every soul will find what it has done of good present 
[before it] and what it has done of evil, it will wish that 
between itself and that [evil] was a great distance.  And All Œh 
warns you of Himself, and All Œh is Kind to [His] servants."
31.Say, [O Muúammad ], "If you should love AllŒh, then follow me, 
[so] All Œh will love you and forgive you your sins.  And All Œh 
is Forgiving and Merciful."
32.Say, "Obey All Œh and the Messenger."  But if they turn away –
then indeed, All Œh does not like the disbel ievers.
33.Indeed, AllŒh chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham
and the family of ÔImrŒn over the worlds –
                                               
102See footnote to 2:19.103When fearing harm from an enemy, the believer may pretend as long as 
his heart and intention are not affected.

4934.Descendants, some of them from others.  And All Œh is Hearing
and Knowing.
35.[Mention, O Muúammad ], when the wife of ÔImrŒn said, "My 
Lord,indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, 
consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me.  
Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing."
36.But when she delivered her, she said, "My Lord, I have delivered
a female."  And All Œh was most kno wing of what she delivered,
and the male is not like the female.  "And I have named her 
Mary, and I seek refuge for her in You and [for] her descendants
from Satan, the expelled [from the mercy of All Œh]."
37.So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her
to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zechariah.  
Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber, 
he found with her provision.  He said, "O Mary, from where is 
this [coming] to you?"  She said, "It is from AllŒh.  Indeed, 
AllŒh provides for whom He wills without account."
38.At that, Zechariah called upon his Lord, saying, "My Lord, 
grant me from Yourself a good offspring.  Indeed, You are the 
Hearer of supplication."
39.So the angels called him while he was stand ing in prayer in 
the chamber, "Indeed, AllŒh gives you good tidings of John, 
confirming a word104from All Œh and [who will be] honorable, 
abstaining [from women], and a prophet from among the righteous."
40.He said, "My Lord, how will I have a boy when I have 
reached old age and my wife is barren?"  He [the angel] said, 
"Such is All Œh; He does what He wills."
41.He said, "My Lord, make for me a sign."  He said, "Your sign 
is that you will not [be able to] speak to the people for three 
days except by gesture .  And remember your Lord much and 
exalt [Him with praise] in the evening and the morning."
                                               
104Referring to the prophet Jesus (upon whom be pea ce), who was conceived
merely by a command from All Œh –the word "Be."

Page 72:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 3
5042.And [mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed AllŒh 
has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the 
women of the worlds.
43.O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and 
bow with those who bow [in prayer]."
44.That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, 
[O Muúammad ].  And you were not with them when they cast 
their pens105as to which of them should be responsible for 
Mary.  Nor were you with them when they disputed.
45.[And mention] when the angels said, "O Mary, indeed AllŒh 
gives you good tidings of a word106from Him, whose name 
will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary –distinguished in 
this world and the Hereaft er and among those brought near [to 
AllŒh].
46.He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and 
will be of the righteous."
47.She said, "My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has 
touched me?"  [The angel] said, "Such is AllŒh; He creates 
what He wills.  When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 
'Be,' and it is.
48.And He will teach him writing and wisdom107and the Torah 
and the Gospel
49.And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who 
will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your 
Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the 
form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by 
permission of All Œh.  And I cure the blind [from birth] and the 
leper, and I give life to the dead –by permission of AllŒh.  
And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your 
houses.  Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.
                                               
105i.e., threw lots.106See footnote to 3:39.107The teachings of the prophets.

S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 3
5150.And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the 
Torah and to make lawful for you some of what wa s forbidden 
to you.  And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, 
so fear All Œh and obey me.
51.Indeed, AllŒh is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  
That is the straight path. '"
52.But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he sa id,
"Who are my supporters for [the cause of] AllŒh?"  The disciples
said, "We are supporters for All Œh.  We have believed in All Œh
and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].
53.Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have 
followed the messenger [i.e., Jesus], so register us among the 
witnesses [to truth]."
54.And they [i.e., the disbelievers] planned, but AllŒh planned.  
And All Œh is the best of planners.
55.[Mention] when AllŒh said, "O Jesus , indeed I will take you 
and raise you to Myself and purify [i.e., free] you from those 
who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission
to All Œh alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day 
of Resurrection.  Then to Me is your return, and I will judge 
between you concerning that in which you used to differ.
56.And as for those who disbelieved, I will punish them with a 
severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they 
will have no helpers."
57.But as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will 
give them in full their rewards, and AllŒh does not like the 
wrongdoers.
58.This is what We recite to you, [O Muúammad ], of [Our] verses
and the precise [and wise] message [i.e., the QurÕ Œn].
59.Indeed, the example of Jesus to All Œh108is like that of Adam.  
He created him from dust; then He said to him, "Be," and he was.
                                               
108i.e., regarding His creation of him.

5260.The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.
61.Then whoever argues with you about it after [this] knowledge 
has come to you –say, "Come, let us call our sons and your sons ,
our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then 
supplicate earnestly [together] and invoke the curse of AllŒh 
upon the liars [among us]."
62.Indeed, this is the true narration.  And there is no deity except 
AllŒh.  And indeed, All Œh is the Exal ted in Might, the Wise.
63.But if they turn away, then indeed –AllŒh is Knowing of the 
corrupters.
64.Say, "O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable 
between us and you –that we will not worship except AllŒh 
and not associate anything with Him and not take one another 
as lords instead of All Œh."109  But if they turn away, then say, 
"Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]."
65.O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham 
while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after 
him?  Then will you not reason?
66.Here you are –those who have argued about that of which 
you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that 
of which you have no knowledge?  And AllŒh knows, while 
you know not.
67.Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one 
inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to AllŒh].  And 
he was not of the polytheists.110
68.Indeed, the most worthy of Abraham among the people are 
those who followed him [in submission to AllŒh] and this 
prophet [i.e., Muúammad ()] and those who believe [in his 
message].  And All Œh is the ally of the believers.
69.A faction of the People of the Scripture wish they could 
                                               
109By obeying another in disobedience to All Œh.110Those who associate others with All Œh.

Page 75:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 3
53mislead you.  But they do not mislead except themselves, and 
they perceive [it] not.
70.O People of the Scrip ture, why do you disbelieve in the verses 
of All Œh111while you witness [to their truth]?
71.O People of the Scripture, why do you mix [i.e., confuse] the 
truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know 
[it]?
72.And a faction of the People of the Scripture say [to each other],
"Believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the 
beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they 
will return [i.e., abandon their religion],
73.And do not trust except those who follow your religi on."  Say, 
"Indeed, the [true] guidance is the guidance of All Œh.  [Do you 
fear] lest someone be given [knowledge] like you were given or
that they would [thereby] argue with you before your Lord?"  
Say, "Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand112of AllŒh –He 
grants it to whom He wills.  And AllŒh is all-Encompassing 
and Wise."
74.He selects for His mercy whom He wills.  And AllŒh is the 
possessor of great bounty.
75.And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you 
entrust him with a great amount [of wealth], he will return it 
to you.  And among them is he who, if you entrust him with 
a [single] silver coin, he will not return it to you unless you 
are constantly standing over him [demanding it].  That is 
because they say, "There is no blame upon us concerning the 
unlearned."113  And they speak untruth about All Œh while they 
know [it].
76.But yes, whoever fulfills his commitment and fears AllŒh –
then indeed, All Œh loves those who fear Him.
                                               
111i.e., deliberately reject them.112See footnote to 2:19.113The Jews do not consider it a sin to cheat or lie to a gentile or a pagan.

Page 76:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 3
5477.Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of All Œh and their [o wn]
oaths for a small price will have no share in the Hereafter, and 
AllŒh will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of 
Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and they will have a 
painful punishment.
78.And indeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture
with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but
it is not from the Scripture.  And they say, "This is from All Œh,"
but it is not from AllŒh.  And they speak untruth about AllŒh 
while they know.
79.It is not for a huma n [prophet]114that AllŒh should give him 
the Scripture115and authority and prophethood and then he 
would say to the people, "Be servants to me rather than All Œh,"
but [instead, he would say], "Be pious scholars of the Lord 
because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because 
of what you have studied."
80.Nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords.   
Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims?
81.And [recall, O People of the Scripture], when AllŒh took the 
covenant of the prophets, [saying], "Whatever I give you of 
the Scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a 
messenger confirming what is with you, you [must] believe in 
him and support him."  [All Œh] said, "Have you acknowledged 
and taken upon that My commi tment?"116  They said, "We 
have acknowledged it."  He said, "Then bear witness, and I am 
with you among the witnesses."
82.And whoever turned away after that –they were the defiantly 
disobedient.
83.So is it other than the religion of AllŒh they desire, while to 
Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, 
willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned?
                                               
114Or any believer.115Or in the case of Prophet Muúammad (), "the Book" (i.e., the QurÕ Œn).116i.e., Have you accepted this obligation?

Page 77:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 3
5584.Say, "We have believed in All Œh and in what was revealed to 
us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, 
and the Descendants [al-AsbŒ‹], and in what was given to 
Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord.  We 
make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims 
[submitting] to Him."
85.And whoever desires other than Isl Œm as religion –never will 
it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be 
among the losers.
86.How shall AllŒh guide a people who disbelieved after their 
belief and had witnessed that the Messenger is true and clear 
signs had come to them?  And AllŒh does not guide the 
wrongdoing people.
87.Those –their recompense will be that upon them is the curse 
of All Œh and the angels and the people, all together,
88.Abiding eternally therein.  The punishment will not be lightened 
for them, nor will they be reprieved,
89.Except for those who repent after that117and correct themselves.   
For indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
90.Indeed, those who disbelieve [i.e., reject the message] after their 
belief and then increase in disbelief –never will their [claimed]
repentanc e be accepted, and they are the ones astray.
91.Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are 
disbelievers –never would the [whole] capacity of the earth in 
gold be accepted from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom
himself with it.  For those there will be a painful punishment, 
and they will have no helpers.
92.Never will you attain the good [reward]118until you spend [in 
the way of AllŒh] from that which you love.  And whatever 
you spend –indeed, All Œh is Knowing of it.
                                               
117After their wrongdoing.118Another meaning is "You will never attain righteousness."

S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
5693.All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what 
Israel [i.e., Jacob] had made unlawful to himself before the Torah
was revealed.  Say, [O Muúammad ], "So bring the Torah and 
recite it, if you should be truthful."
94.And whoever invents about All Œh untruth after that –then those
are [truly] the wrongdoers.
95.Say, "All Œh has told the truth.  So follow the religion of Abraham,
inclining toward truth; and he was not of the polytheists."119
96.Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind 
was that at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah] –blessed and a guidance for 
the worlds.
97.In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham.  
And whoever enters it [i.e., the î aram ] shall be safe.  And [due]
to AllŒh from the people is a pilgrimage to the House –for 
whoever is able to find thereto a way.  But whoever disbelieves
[i.e., refuses] –then indeed, All Œh is free from need of the worlds.120
98.Say, "O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the 
verses of All Œh while All Œh is Witness over what you do?"
99.Say, "O People of the Scripture, why do you avert from the way 
of All Œh those who believe, seeking to make it [seem] deviant, 
while you are witnesses [to the truth]?  And All Œh is not unaware
of what you do."
100.O you who have believed, if you obey a party of those who were
given the Scripture, they would turn you back, after your belief,
[to being] unbelievers.
101.And how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited 
the verses of AllŒh and among you is His Messenger?  And 
whoever h olds firmly to AllŒh121has [indeed] been guided to 
a straight path.
                                               
119See footnote to 3:67.120He has no need for His servants' worship; it is they who are in need of Him.121i.e., adhering to His ordinances strictly, then trusting in Him and relying 
upon Him completely.

S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
57102.O you who have believed, fear AllŒh as He should be feared 
and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].
103.And hold firmly to the rope122of All Œh all together and do not 
become divided.  And remember the favor of All Œh upon you –
when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together 
and you became, by His favor, brothers.  And you were on the 
edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it.  Thus does 
AllŒh make cl ear to you His verses that you may be guided.
104.And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that
is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,123
and those will be the successful.
105.And do not be like the ones who be came divided and differed 
after the clear proofs had come to them.  And those will have 
a great punishment
106.On the Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces 
will turn black.  As for those whose faces turn black, [to them it
will be said], "Did you disbelieve [i.e., reject faith] after your 
belief?  Then taste the punishment for what you used to reject."
107.But as for those whose faces turn white, [they will be] within 
the mercy of All Œh.  They will abide therein eternally.
108.These are the verses of AllŒh.  We recite them to you, [O 
Muúammad ], in truth; and AllŒh wants no injustice to the 
worlds [i.e., His creatures].
109.To AllŒh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is 
on the earth.  And to All Œh will [all] matters be returned.
110.You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind.   
You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe
in AllŒh.  If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it 
would have been better for them.  Among them are believers, 
but most of them are defiantly disobedient.
                                               
122Referring either to His covenant or the QurÕ Œn.123According to the laws of All Œh.

58111.They will not harm you except for [some] annoyance.  And if 
they fight you, they will show you their backs [i.e., retreat]; 
then they will not be aided.
112.They have been put under humiliation [by All Œh] whe rever they
are overtaken, except for a rope [i.e., covenant] from AllŒh 
and a rope [i.e., treaty] from the people [i.e., the Muslims].124  
And they have drawn upon themselves anger from AllŒh and 
have been put under destitution.  That is because they disbeli eved
in [i.e., rejected] the verses of AllŒh and killed the prophets 
without right.  That is because they disobeyed and [habitually]
transgressed.
113.They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture
is a community125standing [in obedience], reciting the verses 
of All Œh during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer].
114.They believe in All Œh and the Last Day, and they enjoin what 
is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds.  
And those are among the righteous.
115.And whatever good they do –never will it be removed from 
them.  And All Œh is Knowing of the righteous.
116.Indeed, those who disbelieve –never will their wealth or their 
children avail them against AllŒh at all, and those are the 
companions of the Fire; th ey will abide therein eternally.
117.The example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that
of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people
who have wronged themselves [i.e., sinned] and destroys it.  
And All Œh has not wronged t hem, but they wrong themselves.
118.O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other 
than yourselves [i.e., believers], for they will not spare you 
                                               
124Once they have surrendered, the People of the Scripture retain their rights 
and honor (in spite of their refusal of IslŒm) through payment of the 
jizyah tax in place of zakŒh and military service due from Muslims.  They 
are then under the protection of the Isl Œmic state.125Of people who accepted Isl Œm.

59[any] ruin.  They wish you would have hardship.  Hatred has 
already appeared from their mouths , and what their breasts
conceal is greater.  We have certainly made clear to you the 
signs, if you will use reason.
119.Here you are loving them but they are not loving you, while 
you believe in the Scripture –all of it.126  And when they meet 
you, they s ay, "We believe."  But when they are alone, they bite
their fingertips at you in rage.  Say, "Die in your rage.   Indeed, 
AllŒh is Knowing of that within the breasts."
120.If good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you,
they rejoice at it .  And if you are patient and fear All Œh, their 
plot will not harm you at all.  Indeed, AllŒh is encompassing 
of what they do.
121.And [remember] when you, [O Muúammad ], left your family 
in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the 
battle [of Uúud] –and All Œh is Hearing and Knowing –
122.When two parties among you were about to lose courage, but 
AllŒh was their ally; and upon All Œh the believers should rely.
123.And already had All Œh given you victory at [the battle of] Badr
while you were weak [i.e., few in number].  Then fear AllŒh; 
perhaps you will be grateful.
124.[Remember] when you said to the believers, "Is it not sufficient
for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand
angels sent down?
125.Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of AllŒh and they 
[i.e., the enemy] come upon you [attacking] in rage, your Lord
will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks [of 
distinction]."
126.And AllŒh made it not except as [a sign of] good tidings for 
you and to reassure your hearts thereby.  And victory is not  
except from All Œh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise –
                                               
126That of it revealed b y All Œh, not what was subsequently altered by men.

60127.That He might cut down a section of the disbelievers or 
suppress them so that they turn back disappointed.
128.Not for you, [O Muúammad , but for AllŒh], is the decision 
whether He should [cut them down] or forgive them or punish 
them, for indeed, they are wrongdoers.
129.And to All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is on the earth.  He forgives whom He wills and punishes 
whom He wil ls.  And All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
130.O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and 
multiplied, but fear All Œh that you may be successful.
131.And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers.
132.And obey All Œh and t he Messenger that you may obtain mercy.
133.And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden [i.e., 
Paradise] as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the 
righteous
134.Who spend [in the cause of AllŒh] during ease and hardship 
and who restrai n anger and who pardon the people –and 
AllŒh loves the doers of good;
135.And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong 
themselves [by transgression], remember AllŒh and seek 
forgiveness for their sins –and who can forgive sins except 
AllŒh? –and [who] do not persist in what they have done 
while they know.
136.Those –their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and 
gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they 
will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the 
[righteous] workers.
137.Similar situations [as yours] have passed on before you, so 
proceed throughout the earth and observe how was the end of 
those who denied.
138.This [QurÕ Œn] is a clear statement to [all] the people and a 
guidance and instruction for those co nscious of All Œh.

Page 83:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
61139.So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior 
if you are [true] believers.
140.If a wound should touch you –there has already touched the 
[opposing] people a wound similar to it.  And these days [of 
varying condition s] We alternate among the people so that 
AllŒh may make evident those who believe and [may] take to 
Himself from among you martyrs –and AllŒh does not like 
the wrongdoers –
141.And that AllŒh may purify the believers [through trials] and 
destroy the disb elievers.
142.Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while AllŒh has 
not yet made evident those of you who fight in His cause and 
made evident those who are steadfast?
143.And you had certainly wished for death [i.e., martyrdom] 
before you encounte red it, and you have [now] seen it [before 
you] while you were looking on.
144.Muúammad is not but a messenger.  [Other] messengers have 
passed on before him.  So if he was to die or be killed, would 
you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]?  And he who turns 
back on his heels will never harm AllŒh at all; but AllŒh will 
reward the grateful.
145.And it is not [possible] for one to die except by permission of 
AllŒh at a decree determined.  And whoever desires the reward
of this world –We will give him th ereof; and whoever desires
the reward of the Hereafter –We will give him thereof.  And 
We will reward the grateful.
146.And how many a prophet [fought and] with him fought many 
religious scholars.  But they never lost assurance due to what 
afflicted them in the cause of AllŒh, nor did they weaken or 
submit.  And All Œh loves the steadfast.
147.And their words were not but that they said, "Our Lord, 
forgive us our sins and the excess [committed] in our affairs 
and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving
people."

Page 84:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
62148.So AllŒh gave them the reward of this world and the good 
reward of the Hereafter.  And All Œh loves the doers of good.
149.O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, 
they will turn you back on your heels, and you will [then] 
become losers.
150.But All Œh is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.
151.We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for 
what they have associated with AllŒh of which He had not 
sent down [any] authority.  And their refuge will be the Fire, 
and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers.
152.And AllŒh had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when 
you were killing them [i.e., the enemy] by His permission 
until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing 
about the order [given by the Prophet ()] and disobeyed 
after He had shown you that which you love.127  Among you 
are some who desire this world, and among you are some 
who desire the Hereafter.  Then He turned you back from 
them [defeated] that He might test you.  And He has already 
forgiven you, and AllŒh is the possessor of bounty for the 
believers.
153.[Remember] when you [fled and] climbed [the mountain] 
without looking aside at anyone while the Messenger was 
calling you from behind.  So AllŒh repaid you with distress 
upon distress so you would not grieve for that which had 
escaped you [of victory and spoils of war] or [for] that which 
had befallen you [of injury and death].  And AllŒh is [fully] 
Acquainted with what you do.
154.Then after distress, He sent down upon you security [in the 
form of] drowsiness, overcoming a faction of you, while 
another faction worried about themselves, thinking of AllŒh 
other than the truth –the thought of ignorance, saying, "Is 
there anything for us [to have done] in this matter?"  Say, 
                                               
127i.e., the spoils of war.

Page 85:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
63"Indeed, the matter belongs completely to AllŒh."  They 
conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you.  
They say, "If there was anything we could have done in the 
matter, we [i.e., some of us] would not have been ki lled right 
here."  Say, "Even if you had been inside your houses, those 
decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds."  
[It was] so that AllŒh might test what is in your breasts and 
purify what is in your hearts.  And AllŒh is Knowing of that 
within the breasts.
155.Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two 
armies met [at Uúud] –it was Satan who caused them to slip 
because of some [blame] they had earned.  But AllŒh has already
forgiven them.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and F orbearing.
156.O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieved
and said about their brothers when they traveled through the 
land or went out to fight, "If they had been with us, they 
would not have died or have been killed," so All Œh makes t hat 
[misconception] a regret within their hearts.  And it is All Œh 
who gives life and causes death, and AllŒh is Seeing of what 
you do.
157.And if you are killed in the cause of AllŒh or die –then 
forgiveness from AllŒh and mercy are better than whatever
they accumulate [in this world].
158.And whether you die or are killed, unto AllŒh you will be 
gathered.
159.So by mercy from AllŒh, [O Muúammad ], you were lenient 
with them.  And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in 
heart, they would have disb anded from about you.  So pardon 
them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the 
matter.  And when you have decided, then rely upon AllŒh.  
Indeed, All Œh loves those who rely [upon Him].
160.If AllŒh should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He 
should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him?  
And upon All Œh let the believers rely.

Page 86:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
64161.It is not [attributable] to any prophet that he would act 
unfaithfully [in regard to war booty].  And whoever betrays, 
[taking unlawfully], will come with what he took on the Day 
of Resurrection.  Then will every soul be [fully] compensated 
for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.
162.So is one who pursues the pleasure of AllŒh like one who 
brings upon himself the anger of AllŒh and whos e refuge is 
Hell?  And wretched is the destination.
163.They are [varying] degrees in the sight of All Œh, and All Œh is 
Seeing of whatever they do.
164.Certainly did AllŒh confer [great] favor upon the believers 
when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, 
reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching 
them the Book [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] and wisdom,128although they 
had been before in manifest error.
165.Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day 
of Uúud], although yo u had struck [the enemy in the battle of 
Badr] with one twice as great, you said, "From where is this?"  
Say, "It is from yourselves [i.e., due to your sin]."   Indeed, 
AllŒh is over all things competent.
166.And what struck you on the day the two armies m et [at Uúud]
was by permission of AllŒh that He might make evident the 
[true] believers
167.And that He might make evident those who are hypocrites.  
For it was said to them, "Come, fight in the way of AllŒh or 
[at least] defend."  They said, "If we had k nown [there would be]
fighting, we would have followed you."  They were nearer to 
disbelief that day than to faith, saying with their mouths what 
was not in their hearts.  And AllŒh is most knowing of what 
they conceal –
168.Those who said about their brothers while sitting [at home], 
"If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed."  
                                               
128The Prophet's sunnah.

Page 87:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
65Say, "Then prevent death from yourselves, if you should be 
truthful."
169.And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of 
AllŒh as dead.  Rather, they are alive with their Lord, 
receiving provision,
170.Rejoicing in what All Œh has bestowed upon them of His bounty,
and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] 
after them who have not yet joined them –that there will be 
no fear concerning th em, nor will they grieve.
171.They receive good tidings of favor from All Œh and bounty and 
[of the fact] that All Œh does not allow the reward of believers 
to be lost –
172.Those [believers] who responded to AllŒh and the Messenger 
after injury had struck them.  For those who did good among 
them and feared All Œh is a great reward –
173.Those to whom people [i.e., hypocrites] said, "Indeed, the 
people have gathered against you, so fear them."  But it [merely]
increased them in faith, and they said, "Suffic ient for us is AllŒh,
and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."
174.So they returned with favor from AllŒh and bounty, no harm
having touched them.  And they pursued the pleasure of All Œh,
and All Œh is the possessor of great bounty.
175.That is only Satan who frightens [you] of his supporters.  So 
fear them not, but fear Me, if you are [indeed] believers.
176.And do not be grieved, [O Muúammad ], by those who hasten 
into disbelief.  Indeed, they will never harm All Œh at all.  All Œh
intends that He should give them no share in the Hereafter,
and for them is a great punishment.
177.Indeed, those who purchase disbelief [in exchange] for faith –
never will they harm AllŒh at all, and for them is a painful 
punishment.
178.And let not those who disbelieve ever think that [because] 
We extend their time [of enjoyment] it is better for them.  We 

Page 88:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
66only extend it for them so that they may increase in sin, and 
for them is a humiliating punishment.
179.AllŒh would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in 
[presently] until He separates the evil from the good.  Nor 
would AllŒh reveal to you the unseen.  But [instead], AllŒh 
chooses of His messengers whom He wills, so believe in 
AllŒh and His messengers.  And if you believe and fear Him, 
then for you is a grea t reward.
180.And let not those who [greedily] withhold what AllŒh has 
given them of His bounty ever think that it is better for them.  
Rather, it is worse for them.  Their necks will be encircled by 
what they withheld on the Day of Resurrection.  And to AllŒh 
belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.  And All Œh, 
with what you do, is [fully] Acquainted.
181.AllŒh has certainly heard the statement of those [Jews] who said, 
"Indeed, AllŒh is poor, while we are rich."  We will record 
what they said and their killing of the prophets without right 
and will say, "Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.
182.That is for what your hands have put forth and because All Œh 
is not ever unjust to [His] servants."
183.[They are] those who said, "Indeed, AllŒhhas taken our 
promise not to believe any messenger until he brings us an 
offering which fire [from heaven] will consume."  Say, "There 
have already come to you messengers before me with clear 
proofs and [even] that of which you speak.  So why did you 
killthem, if you should be truthful?"
184.Then if they deny you, [O Muúammad ] –so were messengers
denied before you, who brought clear proofs and written 
ordinances and the enlightening Scripture.129
185.Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your 
[full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection.  So he who 
is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has 
                                               
129The unaltered, original Torah and Gospel, which were revealed by All Œh.

Page 89:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
67attained [his desire].  And what is the life of this world except
the enjoyment of delusion.
186.You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves.   
And you will surely hear from those who were given the 
Scripture before you and from those who associate others with 
AllŒh much abuse.  But if you are patient and fear AllŒh –
indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of resol ve.
187.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when AllŒh took a covenant 
from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], "You must 
make it clear [i.e., explain it] to the people and not conceal it."  
But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it 
for a small price.  And wretched is that which they purchased.
188.And never think that those who rejoice in what they have 
perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do –
never think them [to be] in safety from the punishment, and 
for them is a painful punishment.
189.And to AllŒh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
earth, and All Œh is over all things competent.
190.Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the 
alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of 
understanding –
191.Who remember AllŒh while standing or sitting or [lying] on 
their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens 
and the earth, [saying], "Our Lord, You did not create this 
aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect 
us from the punishment of the Fire.
192.Our Lord, indeed whoever You admit to the Fire –You have 
disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.
193.Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller [i.e., Prophet 
Muúammad ()] calling to faith, [saying], 'Believe in your 
Lord,' and we have believed.  Our Lord, so forgive us our sins 
and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die among
the righteous.

Page 90:
S´rah 3–li ÔImrŒn JuzÕ 4
68194.Our Lord, and grant us what You promised us through Your
messenger s and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection.   
Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise."
195.And their Lord responded to them, "Never will I allow to be lost
the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female;
you are of one another.  So those who emigrated or were evicted
from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or 
were killed –I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, 
and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers 
flow as reward from AllŒh, and AllŒh has with Him the best 
reward."
196.Be not deceived by the [uninhibited] movement of the 
disbelievers throughout the land.
197.[It is but] a small enjoyment; then their [final] refuge is Hell, 
and wretched is the resting place.
198.But those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath
which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein, asaccommodation
from AllŒh.  And that which is w ith AllŒh is best for the 
righteous.
199.And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who 
believe in AllŒh and what was revealed to you and what was 
revealed to them, [being] humbly submissive to AllŒh.  They 
do not exchange the verses of AllŒh for a small price.  Those 
will have their reward with their Lord.  Indeed, All Œh is swift 
in account.
200.O you who have believ ed, persevere130and endure131and 
remain stationed132and fear All Œh that you may be successful.
                                               
130In your religion and in the face of your enemies.131In patience, outlasting your enemies, and against your own evil 
inclinations.132Posted at your positions against the enemy or in the mosques, awaiting prayers.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 4
69S´rah an -NisŒÕ133
BismillŒhir -RaúmŒnir -Raúeem
1.O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and 
created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many 
men and women.  And fear All Œh, through whom134you ask one 
another,135and the wombs.136  Indeed All Œh is ever,137over you, 
an Observer.
2.And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute 
the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs] .  And do not 
consume their properties into your own.  Indeed, that is ever a 
great sin.
3.And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan 
girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or 
three or four.  But if you fear that you will not be just, then 
[marry only] one or those your right hands possess [i.e., slaves].  
That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].
4.And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts138
graciously.  But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, 
then take it in satisfaction and ease.139
5.And do not give the weak -minded your property,140which All Œh 
                                               
133An-NisŒÕ :  The Women.134In whose name.135i.e., request favors and demand rights.136i.e., fear All Œh in regard to relations of kins hip.137When used in conjunction with AllŒh's attributes, the word "ever" 
(occurring repeatedly throughout this s´rah and elsewhere, such as in 
S´rah al-AúzŒb ) is quite inadequate in imparting the sense of continuation
expressed by the word " kŒna " in Arabic, which indicates "always was, is, 
and always will be."138The obligatory bridal gift ( mahr ).139Knowing that it is lawful.140Although it is their property, AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) refers to it in 
the collective sense, reminding us that all wealth is provide d by Him for 
the maintenance of the community as well as of individual members.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 4
70has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them 
with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropria te
kindness.
6.And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable
age.  Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their
property to them.  And do not consume it excessively and quickly,
[anticipating] that they will grow up.  And whoever, [when acting
as guardian], is self -sufficient should refrain [from taking a fee];
and whoever is poor –let him take according to what is acceptable.   
Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses 
upon them.  And sufficien t is All Œh as Accountant.
7.For men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave,
and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives 
leave, be it little or much –an obligatory share.
8.And when [other] relatives and orphans a nd the needy are present
at the [time of] division, then provide for them [something] out
of it [i.e., the estate] and speak to them words of appropriate 
kindness.
9.And let those [executors and guardians] fear [injustice] as if they
[themselves] had left weak offspring behind and feared for them.   
So let them fear All Œh and speak words of appropriate justice.
10.Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are 
only consuming into their bellies fire.  And they will be burned
in a Blaze [i.e. , Hellfire].
11.AllŒh instructs you concerning your children [i.e., their portions
of inheritance]:  for the male, what is equal to the share of two 
females.  But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for 
them is two thirds of one's estate.141  And if there is only one, 
for her is half.  And for one's parents, to each one of them is a 
sixth of his estate if he left children.  But if he had no children 
and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is 
one third.  And if he had brothers [a nd/or sisters], for his mother
                                               
141Literally, "that which he left."

Page 93:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 4
71is a sixth,142after any bequest he [may have] made or debt.143  
Your parents or your children –you know not which of them 
are nearest to you in benefit.  [These shares are] an obligation 
[imposed] by All Œh.  Indeed, All Œh is ev er Knowing and Wise.
12.And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child.   
But if they have a child, for you is one fourth of what they 
leave, after any bequest they [may have] made or debt.  And 
for them [i.e., the wives] is one fourth if you leave no child.  
But if you leave a child, then for them is an eighth of what 
you leave, after any bequest you [may have] made or debt.  
And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants 
but has a brother or a sister, then for each oneof them is a 
sixth.  But if they are more than two, they share a third,144
after any bequest which was made or debt, as long as there is 
no detriment [caused].145  [This is] an ordinance from AllŒh, 
and All Œh is Knowing and Forbearing.
13.These are the limit s [set by] AllŒh, and whoever obeys AllŒh 
and His Messenger will be admitted by Him to gardens [in 
Paradise] under which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein; 
and that is the great attainment.
14.And whoever disobeys All Œh and His Messenger and transgre sses
His limits –He will put him into the Fire to abide eternally 
therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.
15.Those who commit immorality [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse]
of your women –bring against them four [witnesses] from 
                                               
142Although the siblings themselves do not inherit in this case.143Based upon prophetic úad¥ths, scholars have ruled that debt takes precedent
over a bequest, that a bequest may not include any who inherit by law, 
and that the total bequest may not be more than one third of one's estate.  
After the fulfillment of debts and bequests (if any), the remainder of the 
estate is to be divided according to the ordinances in this s´rah.144These shares are divided equally between males and females.145This is a condition for any bequest.  If it has been violated by the deceased,
his bequest is not to be honored, or it may be adjusted by the executor.  
See 2:182 .

72among you.  And if they testify,146confine them [i.e., the 
guilty women] to houses until death takes them or AllŒh 
ordains for them [another] way.147
16.And the two148who commit it [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse]
among you –punish [i.e., dishonor] them both.  But if they repent
and correct themselves, leave them alone.  Indeed, All Œh is ever
Accepting of repentance and Merciful.
17.The repentance accepted by AllŒh is only for those who do
wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon after.   
It is those to whom All Œh will turn in forgiveness, and All Œh is 
ever Knowing and Wise.
18.But repentance is not [accepted] of those who [continue to] do 
evil deeds up until, when death comes to one of them, he says, 
"Indeed, I have repented now," or of those who die while they are
disbelievers.  For them We have prepared a painful punishment.
19.O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit 
women by compulsion.149  And do not make difficulties for 
them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them150
unless they commit a clear immorality [i.e., adultery].  And 
live with them in kindness.  For if you dislike them –perhaps 
you dislike a thing and All Œh makes therein much good.
20.But if you want to replace one wife with another and you have 
given one of them a great amount [in gifts], do not take [back] 
from it anything.  Would you take it in injustice and manifest 
sin?
                                               
146The witnesses must swear to actually having seen the act taking place.147The "other way" (i.e., penalty ) was later revealed in 24:2, canceling the 
ruling in this verse.148Scholars differ over whether "the two" refers to two of the same sex (i.e., 
homosexua ls) or those of opposite sexes.  In either case, later rulings 
outlined in the sunnah have replaced this one.149The deceased man's heirs have no rights of marriage or otherwise over 
his widow.150At the time of marriage as mahr.

7321.And how could you take it while you have gone in unto each 
other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant?
22.And do not m arry those [women] whom your fathers married, 
except what has already occurred.151  Indeed, it was an immorality
and hateful [to All Œh] and was evil as a way.
23.Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your 
daughters, your sisters, your father's sisters, your mother's 
sisters, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your 
[milk] mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, 
your wives' mothers, and your step-daughters under your 
guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you hav e gone in.   
But if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you.   
And [also prohibited are] the wives of your sons who are from 
your [own] loins, and that you take [in marriage] two sisters 
simultaneously, except for what has already occurred.152  
Indeed, All Œh is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
24.And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except
those your right hands possess.153  [This is] the decree of All Œh
upon you.  And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, 
[provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with [gifts from] 
your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse.   
So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them 
their due compensation154as an obligation.  And there is no 
blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the 
obligation.  Indeed, All Œh is ever Knowing and Wise.
25.And whoever among you cannot [find] the means to marry free, 
believing women, then [he may marry] from those whom your 
right hands possess of believing slave girls.  And AllŒh is most
                                               
151Before Isl Œm.  After the ruli ng was revealed by All Œh, men were required 
to release those women unlawful to them (e.g., a stepmother, one of two 
sisters, or any wives over the limit of four).  The same obligation applies 
to one once he has accepted Isl Œm.152See previous footnote.153i.e., slaves or war captives who had polytheist husbands.154The mahr, a specified gift to the bride required of the man upon marriage.

74knowing about your faith.  You [believers] are of one another.  
So marry them with the permission of their people and give 
them their due compensation [i.e., mahr] according to what is 
acceptable.  [They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who 
commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take 
[secret] lovers.  But once they are sheltered in marriage, if they
should commit adultery, then for them is half the punishment 
for free [unmarried] women.  This [allowance] is for him among
you who fears affliction [i.e., sin], but to be patient is better 
for you.  And All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
26.AllŒh wants to make clear to you [the lawful from the unlawful]
and guide you to the [good] practices of those before you and 
to accept your rep entance.  And All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
27.AllŒh wants to accept your repentance, but those who follow 
[their] passions want you to digress [into] a great deviation.
28.And AllŒh wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and 
mankind was created weak .
29.O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth
unjustly155but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent.  
And do not kill yourselves [or one another].  Indeed, All Œh is 
to you ever Merciful.
30.And whoever does that in aggression and injustice –then We 
will drive him into a Fire.  And that, for All Œh, is [always] easy.
31.If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We will 
remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble 
entrance [into Paradise].
32.And do not wish for that by which AllŒh has made some of 
you exceed others.  For men is a share of what they have 
earned, and for women is a share of156what they have earned.  
And ask AllŒh of His bounty.  Indeed AllŒh is ever, of all 
things, Knowing.
                                               
155i.e., unlawfully or under false pretense.156This may refer to shares of inheritance, wages and reward in the Hereafter.

Page 97:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
7533.And for all, We have made heirs to what is left by parents and 
relatives.  And to those whom your oaths have bound [to you] –
give them their share.157  Indeed All Œh is ever, over all things, 
a Witness.
34.Men are in charge of women158by [right of] what AllŒh has 
given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance]
from their wealth.  So righteous women are devoutly obedient, 
guarding in [the husband's] absence what AllŒh would have 
them guard.159  But those [wives] from whom you fear 
arrogance –[first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake 
them in bed; and [finally], strike them.160  But if they obey you 
[once more], seek no means against them.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
ever Exalted and Grand.
35.And if you fear dissension between the two, send an arbitrator 
from his people and an arbitrator from her people.  If they 
both desire reconciliation, AllŒh will cause it between them.  
Indeed, All Œh is ever Knowing and Acquainted [with all things].
36.Worship All Œh and associate nothing with Him, and to parents 
do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor,
the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side,161the 
traveler, and those whom your right hands possess.  Indeed, 
AllŒh does not like those who are self -deluding and boastful,
37.Who are stingy an d enjoin upon [other] people stinginess and 
conceal what AllŒh has given them of His bounty –and We 
have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment –
38.And [also] those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the 
people and believe not in AllŒh nor in the Last Day.  And he 
to whom Satan is a companion –then evil is he as a companion.
                                               
157By be quest , as only those relatives mentioned in verses 11 and 12 inherit 
fixed shares.158This applies primarily to the husband -wife relationship.159i.e., their husbands' property and their own chastity.160As a last resort.  It is unlawful to strike the face or to cause bodily injury.161i.e., those whose acquaintance you have made.  Also interpreted as the wife.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
7639.And what [harm would come] upon them if they believed in 
AllŒh and the Last Day and spent out of what All Œh provided 
for them?  And All Œh is ever, about the m, Knowing.
40.Indeed, AllŒh does not do injustice, [even] as much as an 
atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it 
and gives from Himself a great reward.
41.So how [will it be] when We bring from every nation a witness 
and We bring y ou, [O Muúammad ], against these [people] as 
awitness?
42.That Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger
will wish they could be covered by the earth.  And they will 
not conceal from All Œh a [single] statement.
43.O you who have believed, donot approach prayer while you 
are intoxicated until you know what you are saying162or in a 
state of janŒbah,163except those passing through [a place of 
prayer], until you have washed [your whole body].  And if 
you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place 
of relieving himself or you have contacted women [i.e., had 
sexual intercourse] and find no water, then seek clean earth 
and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it].  Indeed, 
AllŒh is ever Pardoning and Forgiving.
44.Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the 
Scripture, purchasing error [in exchange for it] and wishing 
you would lose the way?
45.And All Œh is most knowing of your enemies; and sufficient is 
AllŒh as an ally, and sufficient is All Œh as a helper.
46.Among the Jews are those who distort words from their 
[proper] places [i.e., usages] and say, "We hear and disobey" 
and "Hear but be not heard" and "RŒÔinŒ,"164twisting their 
tongues and defaming the religion.  And if they had said [instead],
                                               
162The use of intoxicants was later prohibited completely .  See 5:90-91.163Literally, "distance."  The state of one under obligation to perform ghusl
(a comple te bath) due to having had sexual intercourse or ejaculation.164See footnote to 2:104 .

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
77"We hear and obey" an d "Wait for us [to understand]," it would 
have been better for them and more suitable.  But All Œh has cursed
them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.165
47.O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have 
sent down [to Muú ammad ()], confirming that which is 
with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward 
their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath -breakers .166  
And ever is the matter [i.e., decree] of All Œh accomplished.
48.Indeed, AllŒh does not forgive association with Him, but He 
forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.  And he 
who associates others with AllŒh has certainly fabricated a 
tremendous sin.
49.Have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure?  
Rather, AllŒh purifies whom He wills, and injustice is not  
done to them, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].
50.Look how they invent about AllŒh untruth, and sufficient is 
that as a manifest sin.
51.Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the 
Scripture, who believe in jibt [superstition] and ‹Œgh´t [false 
objects of worship] and say about the disbelievers, "These are 
better guided than the believers as to the way"?
52.Those are the ones whom AllŒh has cursed; and he whom 
AllŒh curses –never will you find for h im a helper.
53.Or have they a share of dominion?  Then [if that were so], 
they would not give the people [even as much as] the speck on 
a date seed.
54.Or do they envy people for what All Œh has given them of His 
bounty?  But We had already given the fam ily of Abraham the 
Scripture and wisdom167and conferred upon them a great 
kingdom.
                                               
165Or "except with little belief."166See 7:163 -166.167Prophetic teachings.

7855.And some among them believed in it,168and some among 
them were averse to it.  And sufficient is Hell as a blaze.
56.Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses –We will drive 
them into a fire.  Every time their skins are roasted through 
We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the 
punishment.  Indeed, All Œh is ever Exalted in Might and Wise.
57.But those who believe and do righteous deeds –We will admit 
them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they 
abide forever.  For them therein are purified spouses, and We 
will admit them to deepening shade.
58.Indeed, All Œh commands you to render trusts to whom they are 
due and when you judge between people t o judge with justice.
Excellent is that which AllŒh instructs you.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
ever Hearing and Seeing.
59.O you who have believed, obey All Œh and obey the Messenger 
and those in authority among you.  And if you disagree over 
anything, refer it to AllŒh and the Messenger, if you should 
believe in All Œh and the Last Day.  That is the best [way] and 
best in result.
60.Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what 
was revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], and what was revealed 
before you?  They wish to refer legislation to ‹Œgh´t ,169while 
they were commanded to reject it; and Satan wishes to lead 
them far astray.
61.And when it is said to them, "Come to what All Œh has revealed
and to the Messenger," you see the hypocrites turning away 
from you in aversion.
62.So how [will it be] when disaster strikes them because of what 
their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing 
by AllŒh, "We intended nothing but good conduct and 
accommodation."
                                               
168In what was given to them.  Also interpreted as "in him," i.e., Muúammad ().169False objects of worship or those transgressors who usurp the divine right 
of government.

7963.Those are the ones of whom All Œh knows what is in their hearts,
so turn away from them170but admonish them and speak to 
them a far -reaching [i.e., effective] word.
64.And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by 
permission of All Œh.  And if, when they wronged themselves, 
they had come to you, [O Muúammad ], and asked forgiveness 
of AllŒh and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, 
they would have found AllŒh Accepting of repentance and 
Merciful.
65.But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they 
make you, [O Muúammad ], judge concerning that over which 
they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves
no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, 
willing] submission.
66.And if We had decreed upon them, "Kill yourselves" or 
"Leave your homes," they would not have done it, except for a 
few of them.  But if they had done what they were instructed, 
it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for 
them in faith].
67.And then We would have given them from Us a great reward.
68.And We would have guided them to a straight path.
69.And whoever obeys All Œh and the Messenger –those will be with
the ones upon whom All Œh has bestowed favor of the prophets,
the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous.  
And excellent are t hose as companions.
70.That is the bounty from All Œh, and sufficient is All Œh as Knower.
71.O you who have believed, take your precaution and [either] go 
forth in companies or go forth all together.
72.And indeed, there is among you he who lingers behin d; and if 
disaster strikes you, he says, "AllŒh has favored me in that I 
was not present with them."
                                               
170i.e., use not violence against them.

Page 102:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
8073.But if bounty comes to you from All Œh, he will surely say, as if
[i.e., showing that] there had never been between you and him 
any affection, "Oh, I wish I had been with them so I could 
have attained a great attainment."171
74.So let those fight in the cause of All Œh who sell the life of this 
world for the Hereafter.  And he who fights in the cause of 
AllŒh and is killed or achieves victory –We will best ow upon 
him a great reward.
75.And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the 
cause of AllŒh and [for] the oppressed among men, women, 
and children who say, "Our Lord, take us out of this city of 
oppressive people and appoint for us from Your self a protector
and appoint for us from Yourself a helper"?
76.Those who believe fight in the cause of All Œh, and those who 
disbelieve fight in the cause of ‹Œgh´t .172  So fight against the 
allies of Satan.  Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.
77.Have you not seen those who were told, "Restrain your hands 
[from fighting]173and establish prayer and give zakŒh"?  But 
then when fighting was ordained for them, at once a party of 
them feared men as they fear All Œh or with [even] greater fear.  
They sai d, "Our Lord, why have You decreed upon us fighting?   
If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time."  Say, 
"The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is 
better for he who fears All Œh.  And injustice will not be done 
to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed]."
78.Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you 
should be within towers of lofty construction.  But if good
comes to them, they say, "This is from All Œh"; and if evil befalls
them, they say,174"This is from you."  Say, "All [things] are 
                                               
171The spoils of war.  Although having pretended to befriend the believers in 
support of All Œh's religion, the hypocrite will not be willing to fight except
for material gain.172See footnote to 4:60.173Before permission was given by All Œh.174Addressing the Prophet ( ).

Page 103:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
81from AllŒh."  So what is [the matter] with those people that 
they can hardly understand any statement?
79.What comes to you of good is from All Œh, but what comes to 
you of evil, [O man], is from yourself.175  And We have sent you,
[O Muúammad ], to the people as a messenger, and sufficient 
is All Œh as Witness.
80.He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed All Œh; but those who
turn away –We have not sent you over them as a guardian.
81.And they say, "[We pledge] obedience."  But when they leave 
you, a group of them spend the night determining to do other 
than what you say.  But All Œh records what they plan by night.  
So leave them alone and rely upon AllŒh.  And sufficient is 
AllŒh as Disposer of affairs.
82.Then do they not reflect upon the QurÕŒn?176  If it had been 
from [any] other than AllŒh, they would have found within it 
much contradiction.
83.And when there comes to them something [i.e., information] 
about [public] security or fear, they spread it around.  But if 
they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of 
authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct 
conclusions from it would have known about it.  And if not 
for the favor of AllŒh upon you and His mercy, you would 
have followed Satan, except f or a few.
84.So fight, [O Muúammad ], in the cause of AllŒh; you are not 
held responsible except for yourself.  And encourage the 
believers [to join you] that perhaps AllŒh will restrain the 
[military] might of those who disbelieve.  And All Œh is greater 
in might and stronger in [exemplary] punishment.177
85.Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share [i.e., 
reward] therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause 
                                               
175As a result of your mistakes or sins.176i.e., its meanings and its objective.177AllŒh is able to defeat them in suc h a way as to deter others from attempting
anything similar.

82will have a portion [i.e., burden] therefrom.  And ever is All Œh,
over all things, a Keeper.178
86.And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] 
with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner].  
Indeed All Œh is ever, over all things, an Accountant.
87.AllŒh –there is no deity except Him.  He will surely assemble 
you for [account on] the Day of Resurrection, about which there
is no doubt.  And who is more truthful than All Œh in statement.
88.What is [the matter] with you [that you are] two groups 
concerning the hypocrites,179while AllŒh has made them fall
back [into error and disbelief] for what they earned.180  Do 
you wish to guide those whom All Œh has sent astray?  And he 
whom All Œh sends astray –never will you find for him a way 
[of guidance].181
89.They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you 
would be alike.  So do not take from among them allies until 
they emigrate for the cause of AllŒh.  But if they turn away 
[i.e., refuse], then seize them and kill them wherever you find 
them and take not from among them any ally or helper,
90.Except forthose who take refuge with a people between 
yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their
hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting 
their own people.  And if AllŒh had willed, He could have 
given them power over you, and they would have fought you.  
So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you 
and offer you peace, then All Œh has not made for you a cause 
[for fighting] against them.
                                               
178Providing, protecting, witnessing, keeping precise records and capable of 
recompense.179i.e., divided between two viewpoints –whether or not they should be 
fought and killed.180As the result of t heir disobedience and disloyalty.181AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) leaves or sends astray those who choose to 
reject His guidance.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
8391.You will find others who wish to obtain security from you and 
[to] obtain security from their people.  Every time they are 
returned to [the influence of] disbelief, they fall back into it.  
So if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or 
restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever 
you overtake them .  And those –We have made for you against
them a clear authorization.
92.And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake.   
And whoever kills a believer by mistake –then the freeing of 
a believing slave and a compensation payment [di yah] presented
to his [i.e., the deceased's] family [is required], unless they 
give [up their right as] charity.  But if he [i.e., the deceased] 
was from a people at war with you and he was a believer –
then [only] the freeing of a believing slave; and if he was from 
apeople with whom you have a treaty –then a compensation 
payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing 
slave.  And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy
one] –then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively,182
[seeking] acceptance of repentance from AllŒh.183  And AllŒh 
is ever Knowing and Wise.
93.But whoever kills a believer intentionally –his recompense is 
Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and AllŒh has become 
angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a 
great punishment.
94.O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the 
cause of AllŒh, investigate; and do not say to one who gives 
you [a greeting of] peace, "You are not a believer,"184aspiring 
for the goods of worldly life; for with All Œh are many acquisitions.   
You [yourselves] were like that before; then AllŒh conferred 
                                               
182Uninterrupted except when there is an IslŒmically valid reason, as in 
Rama dhŒn.183An accidental death usually results from some degree of negligence or 
error for which the believer feels the need to repent.184Do not assume that he pretends Isl Œm merely in order to save himself, for 
he may be sincere in faith.

84His favor [i.e., guidance] upon you, so investigate.  Indeed 
AllŒh is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.
95.Not equal are those believers remaining [at home] –other than 
the disabled –and the mujŒhideen, [who strive and fight] in 
the cause of All Œh with their wealth and their lives.  All Œh has 
preferred the mujŒhideen through their wealth and their lives 
over those who remain [behind], by degrees.  And to all [i.e., both] 
AllŒh has promised the best [reward].  But All Œh has preferred 
the mujŒhideen over those who remain [behind] with a great 
reward –
96.Degrees [of high position] from Him and forgiveness and mercy.   
And All Œh is ever Forgiving and Merc iful.
97.Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging 
themselves185–[the angels] will say, "In what [condition] 
were you?"  They will say, "We were oppressed in the land."  
They [the angels] will say, "Was not the earth of All Œh spacious
[enough] for you to emigrate therein?"  For those, their refuge 
is Hell –and evil it is as a destination.
98.Except for the oppressed among men, women, and children 
who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way186–
99.For those it is expected that All Œh will pardon them, and All Œh 
is ever Pardoning and Forgiving.
100.And whoever emigrates for the cause of All Œh will find on the 
earth many [alternative] locations and abundance.  And 
whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to AllŒh and His 
Messe nger and then death overtakes him –his reward has 
already become incumbent upon AllŒh.  And AllŒh is ever 
Forgiving and Merciful.
101.And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame 
                                               
185By preferring to remain among the disbelievers, although they have the mea ns
to emigrate, in an environment where a Muslim is unable to practice his 
religion freely.186They are prevented by circumstances beyond their control.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
85upon you for shortening the prayer,187[especially] if you fear
that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you.188  
Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.
102.And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among 
them and lead them in prayer,189let a group of them stand [in 
prayer] with you and let them carry their arms.  And when 
they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and 
have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed 
and let them pray with you, taking precaution and carrying 
their arms.  Those who disbelieve w ish that you would neglect 
your weapons and your baggage so they could come down 
upon you in one [single] attack.  But there is no blame upon 
you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down 
your arms, but take precaution.  Indeed, AllŒh has prepared 
for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
103.And when you have completed the prayer, remember AllŒh 
standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides.  But when you 
become secure, re -establish [regular] prayer.  Indeed, prayer has
been decreed upo n the believers a decree of specified times.
104.And do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy.  If you should be 
suffering –so are they suffering as you are suffering, but you 
expect from AllŒh that which they expect not.  And AllŒh is 
ever Knowing and Wise .
105.Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], the Book 
in truth so you may judge between the people by that which 
AllŒh has shown you.  And do not be for the deceitful an 
advocate.
106.And seek forgiveness of All Œh.  Indeed, All Œh is ever Forgivin g
and Merciful.
                                               
187The four rakÔah prayers are shortened to two rakÔahs.188The example of the Prophet ( ) and his companions illustrates that fear 
is not a condition for this allowance, merely travel.189At times of fear on the battleground.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
86107.And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves.  
Indeed, All Œh loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver.
108.They conceal [their evil intentions and deeds] from the people,
but they cannot conceal [them] from AllŒh, and He is with 
them [in His knowledge] when they spend the night in such as 
He does not accept of speech.  And ever is All Œh, of what they 
do, encompassing.
109.Here you are –those who argue on their behalf in [this] 
worldly life –but who will argue with AllŒh for them on the
Day of Resurrection, or who will [then] be their representative?
110.And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks 
forgiveness of All Œh will find All Œh Forgiving and Merciful.
111.And whoever earns [i.e., commits] asin only earns it against 
himself.  And All Œh is ever Knowing and Wise.
112.But whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an 
innocent [person] has taken upon himself a slander and 
manifest sin.
113.And if it was not for the favor of AllŒh upon you, [O 
Muúammad ], and His mercy, a group of them would have 
determined to mislead you.  But they do not mislead except 
themselves, and they will not harm you at all.  And All Œh has 
revealed to you the Book and wisdom and has taught you that 
which you did not know.  And ever has the favor of AllŒh 
upon you been great.
114.No good is there in much of their private conversation, except 
for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation
between people.  And whoever does that seeking mean s to the 
approval of All Œh –then We are going to give him a great reward.
115.And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has 
become clear to him and follows other than the way of the 
believers –We will give him what he has taken190and drive 
him int o Hell, and evil it is as a destination.
                                               
190i.e., make him responsible for his choice.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
87116.Indeed, AllŒh does not forgive association with Him, but He 
forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.  And he 
who associates others with All Œh has certainly gone far astray.
117.They call upon instead of Him none but female [deities], and 
they [actually] call upon none but a rebellious Satan,
118.Whom AllŒh has cursed.  For he had said, "I will surely take 
from among Your servants a specific portion.
119.And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] 
desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of 
cattle, and I will command them so they will change the 
creation of AllŒh."  And whoever takes Satan as an ally 
instead of All Œh has certainly sustained a clear loss.
120.He [i.e., Satan] promises them and arouses desire in them.  
But Satan does not promise them except delusion.
121.The refuge of those will be Hell, and they will not find from it 
an escape.
122.But the ones who believe and do righteous deeds –We will 
admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein 
they will abide forever.  [It is] the promise of All Œh, [which is]
truth, and who is more truthful than All Œh in statement.
123.It [i.e., Paradise] is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking 
nor by that of the People of the Scripture.  Whoever does a 
wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides
AllŒh a protector or a helper.
124.And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, 
while being a believer –those will enter Paradise and w ill not 
be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.
125.And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to 
AllŒh while being a doer of good and follows the religion of 
Abraham, inclining toward truth?  And AllŒh took Abraham 
as an i ntimate friend.
126.And to All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is on the earth.  And ever is All Œh, of all things, encompassing.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 5
88127.And they request from you, [O Muúammad ], a [legal] ruling 
concerning women.  Say, "AllŒh gives you a ruling about 
them and [about] what has been recited to you in the Book 
concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is 
decreed for them191–and [yet] you desire to marry them –and 
concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain
for orphans [their rights] in justice."  And whatever you do of 
good –indeed, All Œh is ever Knowing of it.
128.And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, 
there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement 
between them –and settlement is best.  And present in [human]
souls is stinginess.192  But if you do good and fear All Œh –then 
indeed All Œh is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.
129.And you will never be able to be equal [in feeling] between 
wives, even if you should strive [to do s o].  So do not incline 
completely [toward one] and leave another hanging.193  And if 
you amend [your affairs] and fear AllŒh –then indeed, AllŒh 
is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
130.But if they separate [by divorce], AllŒh will enrich each [of 
them] from Hi s abundance.  And ever is All Œh Encompassing 
and Wise.
131.And to All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is on the earth.  And We have instructed those who were given 
the Scripture before you and yourselves to fear AllŒh.  But if 
you disbel ieve –then to All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is on the earth.  And ever is All Œh Free of need 
and Praiseworthy.
132.And to All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is on the earth.  And sufficient is All Œh as Disposer of affairs.
133.If He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring 
others [in your place].  And ever is All Œh competent to do that.
                                               
191i.e., their rights, in general, and their mahr, specifically.192i.e., holdi ng on to self -interests.193Neither divorced nor enjoying the rights of marriage.

89134.Whoever desires the reward of this world –then with All Œh is 
the reward of this world and the Hereafter.  And ever is All Œh 
Hearing and Seeing.
135.O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice,
witnesses for All Œh, even if it be against yourselves or parents
and relatives.  Whether one is rich or poor, AllŒh is more 
worthy of both.194  So follo w not [personal] inclination, lest 
you not be just.  And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse 
[to give it], then indeed AllŒh is ever, with what you do, 
Acquainted.
136.O you who have believed, believe195in All Œh and His Messenger
and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the 
Scripture which He sent down before.  And whoever disbelieves
in All Œh, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last 
Day has certainly gone far astray.
137.Indeed, those who have believed then disbelieved, then believed
then disbelieved, and then increased in disbelief –never will 
AllŒh forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way.
138.Give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful 
punishment –
139.Those who take disbelievers as allies inste ad of the believers.  
Do they seek with them honor [through power]?  But indeed, 
honor belongs to All Œh entirely.196
140.And it has already come down to you in the Book [i.e., the 
QurÕŒn] that when you hear the verses of All Œh [recited], they 
are denied [bythem] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them 
until they enter into another conversation.  Indeed, you would 
then be like them.197  Indeed, All Œh will gather the hypocrites 
and disbelievers in Hell all together –
                                               
194i.e., more knowledgeable of their best interests.  Therefore, adhere to what
He has enjoined upon you and testify honestly.195i.e., renew, confirm and adhere to your belief.196Being the source of all power and honor, All Œh grants them to whom He wills.197In this world, by participation in their blasphemy, and in the next, where 
you will share their punishment.

90141.Those who wait [and watch] you.  Then if you gain a victory 
from AllŒh, they say, "Were we not with you?"  But if the 
disbelievers have a success, they say [to them], "Did we not 
gain the advantage over you, but we protected you from the 
believers?"  All Œh will judge between [all of] you on the Day 
of Resurrection, and never will AllŒh give the disbelievers 
over the believers a way [to overcome them].198
142.Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive AllŒh, but He is 
deceiving them.  And when they stand for prayer, they stand 
lazily, showing [them selves to] the people and not remembering
AllŒh except a little,
143.Wavering between them, [belonging] neither to these [i.e., the 
believers] nor to those [i.e., the disbelievers].  And whoever
AllŒh leaves astray –never will you find for him a way.
144.O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies
instead of the believers.  Do you wish to give AllŒh against 
yourselves a clear case?
145.Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire –
and never will you find for them a helper –
146.Except for those who repent, correct themselves, hold fast to 
AllŒh,and are sincere in their religion for All Œh, for those will 
be with the believers.  And All Œh is going to give the believers 
a great reward.
147.What would All Œh do with [i.e., gain from] your punishment if 
you are grateful and believe?  And ever is All Œh Appreciative
and Knowing.
148.AllŒh does not like the public mention of evil except by one who 
has been wronged.  And ever is All Œh Hearing and Knowing.
149.If [instead ] you show [some] good or conceal it or pardon an 
offense –indeed, All Œh is ever Pardoning and Competent.199
                                               
198In the Hereafter, but possibly in this world as well.199AllŒh is always able to exact retribution, although He pardons out of His grace.

Page 113:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 6
91150.Indeed, those who disbelieve in AllŒh and His messengers 
and wish to discriminate between AllŒh and His messengers 
and say, "We believe in some and disbelieve in others," and 
wish to adopt a way in between –
151.Those are the disbelievers, truly.  And We have prepared for 
the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.
152.But they who believe in All Œh and His messengers and do not 
discriminate between any of them –to those He is going to 
give their rewards.  And ever is All Œh Forgiving and Merciful.
153.The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a 
book from the heaven.  But they had asked of Moses [even] 
greater than that and said, "Show us AllŒh outright," so the 
thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing.  Then they took
the calf [for worship] after clear evidences had come to them, 
and We pardoned that.  And We gave Moses a clear authority.
154.And We raised over them the moun t for [refusal of] their 
covenant; and We said to them, "Enter the gate bowing humbly";
and We said to them, "Do not transgress on the sabbath"; and 
We took from them a solemn covenant.
155.And [We cursed them]200for their breaking of the covenant 
and thei r disbelief in the signs of All Œh and their killing of the 
prophets without right and their saying, "Our hearts are wrapped"
[i.e., sealed against reception].  Rather, All Œh has sealed them 
because of their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a 
few.201
156.And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying 
against Mary a great slander,202
157.And [for] their saying, "Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, 
Jesus , the son of Mary, the messenger of AllŒh."  And they 
                                               
200Another interpretation is "And [We made certain good foods unlawful to 
them ]," based upon verse 160.201Or "except with little belief."202When they accused her of fornication.

Page 114:
S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 6
92did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was 
made to resemble him to them.  And indeed, those who differ 
over it are in doubt about it.  They have no knowledge of it 
except the following of assumption.  And they did not kill him,
for certain.203
158.Rather, AllŒh raised him to Himself.  And ever is A llŒh 
Exalted in Might and Wise.
159.And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he 
will surely believe in him [i.e., Jesus] before his death.204  And 
on the Day of Resurrection he will be against them a witness.
160.For wrongdoing on the part of the Jews, We made unlawful 
for them [certain] good foods which had been lawful to them, 
and for their averting from the way of All Œh many [people],
161.And [for] their taking of usury while they had been forbidden 
from it, and their consuming of the people's wealth unjustly.  
And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a 
painful punishment.
162.But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers 
believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], 
and what was revealed before you.  And the establishers of 
prayer [especially] and the givers of zakŒh and the believers in 
AllŒh and the Last Day –those We will give a great reward.
163.Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], as We 
revealed to Noah and th e prophets after him.  And We revealed
to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants,205Jesus, 
Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon, and to David We gave the 
book [of Psalms].
                                               
203Another meaning is "And they did not kill him, being certain [of his identity]," 
i.e., they killed another assuming it was Jesus (upon whom be peace).204One interpretation is that "his death" refers to that of Jesus after his return 
to earth.  Or it can mean "the death ofevery individual from among the 
People of the Scripture."205Al-AsbŒ‹.  See footnote to 2:136 .

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 6
93164.And [We sent] messengers about whom We have related 
[their stories] to you before and messengers about whom We 
have not related to you.  And AllŒh spoke to Moses with 
[direct] speech.
165.[We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners 
so that mankind will have no argument against All Œh after the 
messengers.  And ever is All Œh Exalted in Might and Wise.
166.But All Œh bears witness to that which He has revealed to you.  
He has sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear 
witness [as well].  And sufficient is All Œh as Witness.
167.Indeed, those who disbelieve a nd avert [people] from the way 
of All Œh have certainly gone far astray.
168.Indeed, those who disbelieve and commit wrong [or injustice] –
never will AllŒh forgive them, nor will He guide them to a 
path,
169.Except the path of Hell; they will abide there in forever.  And 
that, for All Œh, is [always] easy.
170.O mankind, the Messenger has come to you with the truth 
from your Lord, so believe; it is better for you.  But if you 
disbelieve –then indeed, to AllŒh belongs whatever is in the 
heavens and earth. And ever is All Œh Knowing and Wise.
171.O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your 
religion206or say about AllŒh except the truth.  The Messiah, 
Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of All Œh and His 
word which He directed to Mary and asoul [created at a 
command] from Him.  So believe in All Œh and His messengers.   
And do not say, "Three"; desist –it is better for you.  Indeed, 
AllŒh is but one God.  Exalted is He above having a son.  To 
Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatev er is on 
the earth.  And sufficient is All Œh as Disposer of affairs.
                                               
206Such as attributing divine qualities to certain creations of All Œh or revering
them excessively.

S´rah 4–an-NisŒÕ JuzÕ 6
94172.Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of AllŒh, 
nor would the angels near [to Him].  And whoever disdains 
His worship and is arrogant –He will gather them to Himself 
all together.
173.And as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He 
will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from 
His bounty.  But as for those who disdained and were arrogant,
He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they w ill 
not find for themselves besides All Œh any protector or helper.
174.O mankind, there has come to you a conclusive proof from 
your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.207
175.So those who believe in All Œh and hold fast to Him –He will 
admit them to mercy from Himself and bounty and guide 
them to Himself on a straight path.
176.They request from you a [legal] ruling.  Say, "All Œh gives you 
a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor 
ascendants [as heirs]."  If a man dies, leaving no child but 
[only] a sister, she will have half of what he left.  And he 
inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child.  But if there 
are two sisters [or more], they will have two thirds of what he 
left.  If there are both brothers and sisters, the mal e will have 
the share of two females.  All Œh makes clear to you [His law],
lest you go astray.  And All Œh is Knowing of all things .

1.O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts.209  Lawful for 
you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is 
recited to you [in this QurÕŒn] –hunting not being permitted 
while you are in the state of iúrŒm.210  Indeed, AllŒh ordains 
what He intends.
2.O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of AllŒhor 
[the sanctity of] the sacred month or [neglect the marking of] 
the sacrificial animals and garlanding [them] or [violate the 
safety of] those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty 
from their Lord and [His] approval.  But when you come out of 
iúrŒm,then [you may] hunt.  And do not let the hatred of a 
people for having obstructed you from al -Masjid al -îarŒm lead 
you to transgress.  And cooperate in righteousness and piety, 
but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.  And fear AllŒh; 
indeed, All Œh is severe in penalty.
3.Prohibited to you are dead animals,211blood, the flesh of swine, 
and that which has been dedicated to other than AllŒh, and 
[those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a 
head -long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a 
wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter 
[before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars,212
and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows.   
That is grave disobedience.  This d ay those who disbelieve have 
despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me.   
This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My

96favor upon you and have approved for you IslŒm as religion.  
But whoever is forced by seve re hunger with no inclination to sin –
then indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
4.They ask you, [O Muúammad ], what has been made lawful for 
them.  Say, "Lawful for you are [all] good foods and [game caught
by] what you have trained of hunting animals213which you train 
as All Œh has taught you.  So eat of what they catch for you, and 
mention the name of AllŒh upon it, and fear AllŒh."  Indeed, 
AllŒh is swift in account.
5.This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food 
of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and 
your food is lawful for them.  And [lawful in marriage are] 
chaste women from among the believers and chaste women 
from among those who were given the Scripture before you, 
when you have given them their due compensa tion,214desiring 
chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers.   
And whoever denies the faith –his work has become worthless, 
and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.
6.O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, 
wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over 
your heads and wash your feet to the ankles.  And if you are in a 
state of janŒbah,215then purify yourselves.  But if you are ill or on
a journey or one of you comes from the place of reli eving himself
or you have contacted women216and do not find water, then seek 
clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it.  All Œh does 
not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify 
you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.
7.And remember the favor of AllŒh upon you and His covenant with
which He bound you when you said, "We hear and we obey"; 
and fear All Œh.  Indeed, All Œh is Knowing of that within the breasts.
                                               
213Such as dogs, falcons, etc.214The specified bridal gift ( mahr ).215See footnote to 4:43.216i.e., had sexual intercourse.

978.O you who have believed, be persistently stan ding firm for All Œh,
witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent 
you from being just.  Be just; that is nearer to righteousness.  
And fear All Œh; indeed, All Œh is Acquainted with what you do.
9.AllŒh has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds 
[that] for them there is forgiveness and great reward.
10.But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs –those are the 
companions of Hellfire.
11.O you who have believed, remember the favor of All Œh upon you
when a people determine d to extend their hands [in aggression]
against you, but He withheld their hands from you; and fear 
AllŒh.  And upon All Œh let the believers rely.
12.And All Œh had already taken a covenant from the Children of 
Israel, and We delegated from among them twel ve leaders.  And
AllŒh said, "I am with you.  If you establish prayer and give 
zakŒh and believe in My messengers and support them and loan
AllŒh a goodly loan,217I will surely remove from you your 
misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow .  
But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed 
from the soundness of the way."
13.So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and 
made their hearts hardened .  They distort words from their 
[proper] places [i.e., usages] and have forgotten a portion of 
that of which they were reminded.218  And you will still 
observe deceit among them, except a few of them.  But pardon 
them and overlook [their misdeeds].  Indeed, AllŒh loves the 
doers of good.
14.And from those who say, "We are Christians" We took their 
covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were 
reminded.219  So We caused among them220animosity and 
                                               
217By spending in the cause of All Œh, seeking His reward.218In the Torah concerning the coming of Prophet Muúammad ( ).219In the Gospel concerning the coming of Prophet Muúammad ( ).220i.e., among their various denominations or sects.

S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
98hatred until the Day of Resurrection.  And AllŒh is going to 
inform them about what they used to do.
15.O People of t he Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger
making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the 
Scripture and overlooking much.221  There has come to you 
from All Œh a light and a clear Book [i.e., the QurÕ Œn]
16.By which AllŒh guides those who pursue His pleasure to the 
ways of peace222and brings them out from darknesses into the 
light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.
17.They have certainly disbelieved who say that AllŒh is Christ, 
the son of Mary.  Say, "Then who could p revent All Œh at all if 
He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother
or everyone on the earth?"  And to All Œh belongs the dominion
of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them.  
He creates what He wills, and All Œh is over a ll things competent.
18.But the Jews and the Christians say, "We are the children of 
AllŒh and His beloved."  Say, "Then why does He punish you 
for your sins?"  Rather, you are human beings from among 
those He has created.  He forgives whom He wills, and He 
punishes whom He wills.  And to All Œh belongs the dominion 
of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, 
and to Him is the [final] destination.
19.O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger
to make clear to you [the rel igion] after a period [of suspension]
of messengers, lest you say, "There came not to us any bringer 
of good tidings or a warner."  But there has come to you a 
bringer of good tidings and a warner.  And AllŒh is over all 
things competent.
20.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Moses said to his people,
"O my people, remember the favor of AllŒh upon you when 
                                               
221Of your sin in that regard.222i.e., security, well-being, integrity and escape from Hellfire.  Literally, 
"freedom from all evil."

S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
99He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors223
and gave you that which He had not given anyone among the 
worlds.
21.O my people, enter the Holy Land [i.e., Palestine] which All Œh
has assigned to you and do not turn back [from fighting in 
AllŒh's cause] and [thus] become losers."
22.They said, "O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical 
strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until t hey leave it; 
but if they leave it, then we will enter."
23.Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom 
AllŒh had bestowed favor, "Enter upon them through the gate, 
for when you have entered it, you will be predominant.224  
And upon All Œh rely , if you should be believers."
24.They said, "O Moses, indeed we will not enter it, ever, as long 
as they are within it; so go, you and your Lord, and fight.  
Indeed, we are remaining right here."
25.[Moses] said, "My Lord, indeed I do not possess [i.e., control] 
except myself and my brother, so part us225from the defiantly 
disobedient people."
26.[AllŒh] said, "Then indeed, it is forbidden to them for forty 
years [in which] they will wander throughout the land.  So do 
not grieve over the defiantly disobe dient people."
27.And recite to them the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, 
when they both offered a sacrifice [to All Œh], and it was accepted
from one of them but was not accepted from the other.  Said 
[the latter], "I will surely kill you."  Said [the former], "Indeed,
AllŒh only accepts from the righteous [who fear Him].
28.If you should raise your hand against me to kill me –I shall 
                                               
223Of all that you need –specifically, homes, wives and servants.  Or 
"sovereigns," i.e., those of independent authority.224i.e., If you obey the command of All Œh trusting in Him, He will fulfill His 
promise to you.225Or "distinguish us" or "judge between us."

Page 122:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
100not raise my hand against you to kill you.  Indeed, I fear All Œh,
Lord of the worlds.
29.Indeed, I want you to obtain [thereby] my sin and your sin so 
you will be among the companions of the Fire.  And that is the 
recompense of wrongdoers."
30.And his soul permitted to him226the murder of his brother, so 
he killed him and became among the losers.
31.Then AllŒh sent a crow searching [i.e., scratching] in the 
ground to show him how to hide the disgrace227of his brother.  
He said, "O woe to me!  Have I failed to be like this crow and 
hide the disgrace [i.e., body] of my brother?"  And he became 
of the regretful.
32.Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that 
whoever kills a soul unless for a soul228or for corruption 
[done] in the land229–it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.  
And whoever saves one230–it is as if he had saved mankind 
entirely.  And Our me ssengers had certainly come to them with
clear proofs.  Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, 
throughout the land, were transgressors.231
33.Indeed, the penalty232for those who wage war233against All Œh 
and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption 
is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands 
and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled 
from the land.  That is for them a disgrace in this world; and 
for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,
                                               
226i.e.,the killer allowed himself.227Referring to the dead body, evidence of his shameful deed.228i.e., in legal retribution for murder.229i.e., that requiring the death penalty.230Or refrains from killing.231Heedless of All Œh's limits, negligent of their responsibil ities.232Legal retribution.233i.e., commit acts of violence and terrorism against individuals or treason 
and aggression against the Isl Œmic state.

S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
10134.Except for those who return [repenting] before you overcome 
[i.e., apprehend] them.  And know that All Œh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
35.O you who have believed, fear AllŒh and seek the means [of 
nearness] to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed .
36.Indeed, those who disbelieve –if they should have all that is 
in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom 
themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it 
will not be accepted from them, and for them is a painful 
punishme nt.
37.They will wish to get out of the Fire, but never are they to 
emerge therefrom, and for them is an enduring punishment.
38.[As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their 
hands in recompense for what they earned [i.e., committed] as 
a deterrent [punishment] from All Œh.  And All Œh is Exalted in 
Might and Wise.
39.But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed,
AllŒh will turn to him in forgiveness.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving
and Merciful.
40.Do you not know that to AllŒh belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth?  He punishes whom He wills and forgives
whom He wills, and All Œh is over all things competent.
41.O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief
of those who say, "We believe" with their mouths, but their 
hearts believe not, and from among the Jews.  [They are] avid 
listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have 
not come to you.234  They distort words beyond their [proper] 
places [i.e., usages], saying, "If you are given this,235take it; 
but if you are not given it, then beware."  But he for whom 
AllŒh intends fitnah236–never will you possess [power to do] 
                                               
234They had not attended the Prophet's gatherings or heard his words.235The legal ruling desired by them.236The mea ning here is misbelief, misconception, or self -delusion as a result 
of one's own refusal of truth.

Page 124:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
102for him a thing against AllŒh.  Those are the ones for whom 
AllŒh does not intend to purify their hearts.  For them in this 
world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great 
punishment.
42.[They are] avid listeners to falsehood, devourers of [what is] 
unlawful.  So if they come to you, [O Muúammad ], judge 
between them or turn away from them.  And if you turn away 
from them –never will they harm you at all.  And if you 
judge, judge between them with justice.  Indeed, AllŒh loves 
those who act justly.
43.But how is it that they come to you for judgement while they 
have the Torah, in which is the judgement of All Œh?  The n they
turn away, [even] after that; but those are not [in fact] believers.
44.Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and 
light.  The prophets who submitted [to All Œh] judged by it for 
the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which 
they were entrusted of the Scripture of AllŒh, and they were 
witnesses thereto.  So do not fear the people but fear Me, and 
do not exchange My verses for a small price [i.e., worldly gain].   
And whoever does not judge by what AllŒh has revealed –
then it is those who are the disbelievers.
45.And We ordained for them therein a life for a life, an eye for 
an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, 
and for wounds is legal retribution.  But whoever gives [up his 
right as] charity, it is an expiation for him.  And whoever does 
not judge by what AllŒh has revealed –then it is those who 
are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].
46.And We sent, following in their footsteps,237Jesus, the son of 
Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; 
and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light 
and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance
and instruction for the righteous.
                                               
237i.e., following the tradition of the prophets of the Children of Israel.

Page 125:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
10347.And let the People of the Gospel judge by what AllŒh has 
revealed therein.  And w hoever does not judge by what All Œh 
has revealed –then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.
48.And We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], the Book [i.e., 
the QurÕŒn] in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the 
Scripture and as a criterio n over it.  So judge between them by 
what AllŒh has revealed and do not follow their inclinations 
away from what has come to you of the truth.  To each of you 
We prescribed a law and a method.238  Had AllŒh willed, He 
would have made you one nation [united i n religion], but [He 
intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all 
that is] good.239  To All Œh is your return all together, and He will
[then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.
49.And judge, [O Muúammad ], between th em by what All Œh has 
revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them,
lest they tempt you away from some of what All Œh has revealed
to you.  And if they turn away –then know that All Œh only intends 
to afflict them with some of their [own] sins.  And indeed, 
many among the people are defiantly disobedient.
50.Then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignorance they desire?   
But who is better than AllŒh in judgement for a people who 
are certain [in faith].
51.O you who have believed, do no t take the Jews and the Christians
as allies.  They are [in fact] allies of one another.  And whoever
is an ally to them among you –then indeed, he is [one] of them.   
Indeed, All Œh guides not the wrongdoing people.
52.So you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] 
hastening into [association with] them, saying, "We are afraid 
a misfortune may strike us."  But perhaps AllŒh will bring 
conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over 
what they have been concealing within themselves , regretful.
                                               
238Prior to this revelation, which supersedes all previous scriptures.239i.e., obedien ce to All Œh according to what He enjoined in the QurÕ Œn and 
through the sunnah of His Prophet ().

Page 126:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
10453.And those who believe will say,240"Are these the ones who 
swore by AllŒh their strongest oaths that indeed they were 
with you?"  Their deeds have become worthless, and they 
have become losers.
54.O you who have believed, whoever of you sho uld revert from 
his religion –AllŒh will bring forth [in place of them] a 
people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble 
toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they 
strive in the cause of All Œh and do not fear the blame of a critic.   
That is the favor of All Œh; He bestows it upon whom He wills.  
And All Œh is all -Encompassing and Knowing.
55.Your ally is none but All Œh and [therefore] His Messenger and 
those who have believed –those who establish prayer and 
give zakŒh, and th ey bow [in worship].
56.And whoever is an ally of All Œh and His Messenger and those 
who have believed –indeed, the party of All Œh –they will be 
the predominant.
57.O you who have believed, take not those who have taken your 
religion in ridicule and amu sement among the ones who were 
given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies.  
And fear All Œh, if you should [truly] be believers.
58.And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and 
amusement.  That is because they are a people w ho do not use 
reason.
59.Say, "O People of the Scripture, do you resent us except [for 
the fact] that we have believed in All Œh and what was revealed 
to us and what was revealed before and because most of you 
are defiantly disobedient?"
60.Say, "Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that241as 
penalty from AllŒh?  [It is that of] those whom AllŒh has 
                                               
240About the hypocrites after their exposure.241Referring to the punishment the People of the Scripture (in their censure 
of the Muslims) claimed was deserved b y them.

Page 127:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
105cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them 
apes and pigs and slaves of ‹Œgh´t .242  Those are worse in 
position and further astray from the sound way."
61.And when they come to you, they say, "We believe."  But 
they have entered with disbelief [in their hearts], and they 
have certainly left with it.  And AllŒh is most knowing of 
what they were concealing.
62.And you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression 
and the devouring of [what is] unlawful.  How wretched is 
what they have been doing.
63.Why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from 
saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful?  How 
wretched is what they have been practicing.
64.And the Jews say, "The hand of All Œh is chained."243  Chained 
are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say.  Rather, 
both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills.  
And that which has been revealed to you from your L ord will 
surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief.  
And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the 
Day of Resurrection.  Every time they kindled the fire of war 
[against you], All Œh extinguished it.  And they strive throughou t
the land [causing] corruption, and All Œh does not like corrupters.
65.And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and 
feared AllŒh, We would have removed from them their 
misdeeds and admitted them to Gardens of Pleasure.
66.And if only they ha d upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel,
and what has been revealed to them from their Lord [i.e., the 
QurÕŒn], they would have consumed [provision] from above 
them and from beneath their feet.244  Among them are a 
moderate [i.e., acceptable] community, but many of them –
evil is that which they do.
                                               
242See footnote to 2:256 .243Implying inability to give or stinginess.244i.e., in great abundance.

Page 128:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 6
10667.O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you
from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed
His message.  And AllŒh will protect you from the people.  
Indeed, All Œh does not gui de the disbelieving people.
68.Say, "O People of the Scripture, you are [standing] on nothing 
until you uphold [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what 
has been revealed to you from your Lord [i.e., the QurÕŒn]."  
And that which has been revealed to y ou from your Lord will 
surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief.  
So do not grieve over the disbelieving people.
69.Indeed, those who have believed [in Prophet Muúammad ()] 
and those [before him ()] who were Jews or Sabeans or 
Christians –those [among them] who believed in AllŒh and 
the Last Day and did righteousness –no fear will there be 
concerning them, nor will they grieve.245
70.We had already taken the covenant ofthe Children of Israel 
and had sent to them messengers.  Whenever there came to 
them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party 
[of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.
71.And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, 
so they became blind and deaf.  Then All Œh turned to them in 
forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf.   
And All Œh is Seeing of what they do.
72.They have certainly disbelieved who say, "All Œh is the Messiah, 
the son of Mary" while the Messiah has said, "O Children of 
Israel, worship AllŒh, my Lord and your Lord."  Indeed, he 
who associates others with AllŒh –AllŒh has forbidden him 
Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire.  And there are not for the 
wrongdoers any helpers.
73.They have certainly disbelieved who say, "All Œh is the third of 
three."246  And there is no god except one God.  And if they do
                                               
245See footnote to 2:62.246i.e., one part of three, referring to the Christian concept of trinity.

Page 129:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
107not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict 
the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.
74.So will they not repent to AllŒh and seek His forgiveness?  
And All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
75.The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] 
messengers have passed on before him.  And his mother was a 
supporter of truth.  They both used to eat food.247  Look how 
We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.
76.Say, "Do you worship besides All Œh that which holds for you 
no [power of] harm or benefit while it is All Œh who is the 
Hearing, the Knowing?"
77.Say, "O People of the Script ure, do not exceed limits in your 
religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of 
a people who had gone astray before and misled many and 
have strayed from the soundness of the way."
78.Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel
by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary.  That 
was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.
79.They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that 
they did.  How wretched was that which they were doing.
80.You se e many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved
[i.e., the polytheists].  How wretched is that which they have 
put forth for themselves in that AllŒh has become angry with 
them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally.
81.And if they had b elieved in All Œh and the Prophet and in what 
was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies; 
but many of them are defiantly disobedient.
82.You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity
toward the believers [to be] the Je ws and those who associate 
others with AllŒh; and you will find the nearest of them in 
affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians."  
                                               
247They were in need of sustenance, proving that they were creations of 
AllŒh, not divine beings.

Page 130:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
108That is because among them are priests and monks and because
they are not arrogant.
83.And when they hea r what has been revealed to the Messenger, 
you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they
have recognized of the truth.  They say, "Our Lord, we have 
believed, so register us among the witnesses.
84.And why should we not believe in AllŒh and what has come 
to us of the truth?  And we aspire that our Lord will admit us 
[to Paradise] with the righteous people."
85.So All Œh rewarded them for what they said248with gardens [in 
Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally.   
And that is the reward of doers of good.
86.But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs –they are the 
companions of Hellfire.
87.O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things 
which AllŒh has made lawful to you and do not transgress.  
Indeed, AllŒh does not like transgressors.
88.And eat of what All Œh has provided for you [which is] lawful 
and good.  And fear All Œh, in whom you are believers.
89.AllŒh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless249
in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking]
what you intended of oaths.  So its expiation250is the feeding 
of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed 
your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave.  
But whoever cannot find [or afford it] –then a fast of three days
[is required].  That is the expiation for oaths when you have 
sworn.  But guard your oaths.251  Thus does All Œh make clear 
to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.
                                               
248i.e., their admission and acceptance of the truth and commitment to 
AllŒh's religion (Isl Œm).249i.e., what is sworn to only out of habit of speech or what one utters 
carelessly without true intent.250i.e., that for a de liberate oath.251i.e., do not take oaths indiscriminately or swear to do that which is sinful, 
requiring expiation.

10990.O you who have believed, indeed, intoxi cants, gambling, 
[sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than All Œh], and divining 
arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid252
it that you may be successful.
91.Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred 
through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the 
remembrance of All Œh and from prayer.  So will you not desist?
92.And obey All Œh and obey the Messenger and beware.  And if 
you turn away –then know that upon Our Messenger is only 
[the responsibility for] clear no tification.
93.There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness 
[any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if 
they [now] fear All Œh and believe and do righteous deeds, and 
then fear All Œh and believe, and then fear All Œh and do good ; 
and All Œh loves the doers of good.
94.O you who have believed, AllŒh will surely test you through 
something of the game that your hands and spears [can] reach, 
that AllŒh may make evident those who fear Him unseen.  
And whoever transgresses after that –for him is a painful 
punishment.
95.O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the
state of iúrŒm.253  And whoever of you kills it intentionally –
the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what 
he killed, as judged by two jus t men among you as an offering 
[to All Œh] delivered to the KaÔbah, or an expiation:  the feeding
of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting, that he 
may taste the consequence of his matter [i.e., deed].  All Œh has 
pardoned what is past; but whoev er returns [to violation], then 
AllŒh will take retribution from him.  And All Œh is Exalted in 
Might and Owner of Retribution.
                                               
252The prohibition understood from the word "avoid" is stronger than if 
AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) had merely said, "Abstain."  The former 
requires distancing oneself from anything remotely related to these practices.253See footnote to 5:1.

S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
11096.Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision 
for you and the travelers,254but forbidden to you is game from 
the land as long as you are in the state of iúrŒm.  And fear 
AllŒh to whom you will be gathered.
97.AllŒh has made the KaÔbah, the Sacred House, standing255for 
the people and [has sanctified] the sacred months and the 
sacrificial animals and the garlands [ by which they are identified].   
That is so you may know that AllŒh knows what is in the 
heavens and what is in the earth and that All Œh is Knowing of 
all things.
98.Know that All Œh is severe in penalty and that All Œh is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
99.Not upon the Messenger is [responsibility] except [for] 
notification.  And AllŒh knows whatever you reveal and 
whatever you conceal.
100.Say, "Not equal are the evil and the good, although the 
abundance of evil might impress you."  So fear AllŒh, O you 
of unde rstanding, that you may be successful.
101.O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if 
they are shown to you, will distress you.  But if you ask about 
them while the QurÕ Œn is being revealed, they will be shown to 
you.  All Œh has pardoned i t [i.e., that which is past]; and All Œh 
is Forgiving and Forbearing.
102.A people asked such [questions] before you; then they became
thereby disbelievers.256
103.AllŒh has not appointed [such innovations as] baú¥rah or 
sŒÕibah or wa§¥lah or ú Œm.257  But tho se who disbelieve invent 
falsehood about All Œh, and most of them do not reason.
                                               
254Fishing and eating whatever is caught from the sea is permitted even 
during iúrŒm.255Conspicuously as a symbol of All Œh's religion.256By their unwillingness to carry out what was commanded of them.257Categories of particular camels which were dedicated to the idols and set 
free to pasture, liberated from the service of man.

S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
111104.And when it is said to them, "Come to what AllŒh has 
revealed and to the Messenger," they say, "Sufficient for us is 
that upon which we found our fathers."  Even though their 
fathers knew nothing, nor were they guided?
105.O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for]
yourselves.  Those who have gone astray will not harm you when
you have been guided.  To AllŒh is your return all together; 
then He will inform y ou of what you used to do.
106.O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among 
you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest –
[that of] two just men from among you or two others from 
outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster 
of death should strike you.  Detain them after the prayer and 
let them both swear by AllŒh if you doubt [their testimony, 
saying], "We will not exchange it [i.e., our oath] for a price 
[i.e., worldly gain], even if he should be a near relative, and 
we will not withhold the testimony of [i.e., ordained by] All Œh.  
Indeed, we would then be of the sinful."
107.But if it is found that those two were guilty of sin [i.e., perjury],
let two others stand in their place [who are] foremost [in claim ]
from those who have a lawful right.  And let them swear by 
AllŒh, "Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have
not transgressed.  Indeed, we would then be of the wrongdoers."
108.That is more likely that they will give testimony according t o 
its [true] objective, or [at least] they would fear that [other] 
oaths might be taken after their oaths.  And fear AllŒh and 
listen [i.e., obey Him]; and All Œh does not guide the defiantly 
disobedient people.
109.[Be warned of] the Day when AllŒh will assemble the 
messengers and say, "What was the response you received?"  
They will say, "We have no knowledge.  Indeed, it is You 
who is Knower of the unseen" –
110.[The Day] when AllŒh will say, "O Jesus, Son of Mary, 
remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I 
supported you with the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel] 

Page 134:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
112and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and 
[remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the 
Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay 
[wha t was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then 
you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission;
and you healed the blind [from birth] and the leper with My 
permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My 
permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from 
[killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and 
those who disbelieved among them said, "This is not but 
obvious magic."
111.And [remember] when I inspired to the disciples, "Believe in 
Me and in My messen ger [i.e., Jesus]."  They said, "We have 
believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims [in 
submission to All Œh]."
112.[And remember] when the disciples said, "O Jesus, Son of Mary,
can your Lord258send down to us a table [spread with food] 
from the heaven?"  [Jesus] said, "Fear All Œh, if you should be 
believers."
113.They said, "We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be 
reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be 
among its witnesses."
114.Said Jesus, the son of Mary, "O AllŒh, our Lord, send down 
to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a 
festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from 
You.  And provide for us, and You are the best of providers."
115.AllŒh said, "Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever 
disbelieves afterwards from among you –then indeed will I 
punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished 
anyone among the worlds."
116.And [beware the Day] when AllŒh will say, "O Jesus, Son of 
Mary, did you say to the peopl e, 'Take me and my mother as 
deities besides AllŒh?'"  He will say, "Exalted are You!  It 
                                               
258i.e., will All Œh consent to.  (His ability is undoubted.)

Page 135:
S´rah 5–al-MŒÕidah JuzÕ 7
113was not for me to say that to which I have no right.  If I had 
said it, You would have known it.  You know what is within 
myself, and I do not know what is within You rself.  Indeed, it 
is You who is Knower of the unseen.
117.I said not to them except what You commanded me –to 
worship All Œh, my Lord and your Lord.  And I was a witness 
over them as long as I was among them; but when You took 
me up, You were the Observe r over them, and You are, over 
all things, Witness.
118.If You should punish them –indeed they are Your servants; 
but if You forgive them –indeed it is You who is the Exalted 
in Might, the Wise."
119.AllŒh will say, "This is the Day when the truthful w ill benefit 
from their truthfulness."  For them are gardens [in Paradise] 
beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, 
AllŒh being pleased with them, and they with Him.  That is 
the great attainment.
120.To AllŒh belongs the dominion of theheavens and the earth 
and whatever is w ithin them.  And He is over all things 
competent.

114S´rah al -AnÔŒm259
BismillŒhir -RaúmŒnir -Raúeem
1.[All] praise is [due] to AllŒh, who created the heavens and the 
earth and made the darkness and the light.  Then those who 
disbelieve equate [others] with their Lord.
2.It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term260and
a specified time [known] to Him;261then [still] you are in dispute.
3.And He is All Œh, [the only deity] in the heavens and the earth.  
He kn ows your secret and what you make public, and He knows 
that which you earn.
4.And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except 
that they turn away therefrom.
5.For they had denied the truth when it came to them, but there is 
going to reach t hem the news of what they used to ridicule.262
6.Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before 
them which We had established upon the earth as We have not 
established you?  And We sent [rain from] the sky upon them in 
showers and made rivers f low beneath them; then We destroyed 
them for their sins and brought forth after them a generation of 
others.
7.And even if We had sent down to you, [O Muúammad ], a 
written scripture on a page and they touched it with their hands, 
the disbelievers would sa y, "This is not but obvious magic."
8.And they say, "Why was there not sent down to him an angel ?"263
                                               
259Al-AnÔŒm :  The Grazing Livesto ck, specifically:  camels, cattle, sheep and 
goats , as mentioned in verses 143-144 of this s´rah .260An appointed time for death.261For resurrection.262They will experience the reality of what they had denied and the consequence
of their denial.263In support of his prophethood ().

Page 137:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
115But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have 
been decided;264then they would not be reprieved.
9.And if We had made him [i.e., the messenger ] an angel, We 
would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have 
covered them with that in which they cover themselves [i.e., 
confusion and doubt].
10.And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who
mocked them were enveloped by tha t which they used to ridicule.
11.Say, "Travel through the land; then observe how was the end 
of the deniers."
12.Say, "To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?"   
Say, "To All Œh."  He has decreed upon Himself mercy.  He will 
surely assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which 
there is no doubt.  Those who will lose themselves [that Day] 
donot believe.
13.And to Him belongs that which reposes by night and by day, 
and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
14.Say, "Is it other than AllŒh Ishould take as a protector, 
Creator of the heavens and earth, while it is He who feeds and 
is not fed?"  Say, [O Muúammad ], "Indeed, I have been 
commanded to be the first [among you] who submit [to All Œh] 
and [was commanded], 'Do not ever be of the polyth eists. '"
15.Say, "Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment
of a tremendous Day."
16.He from whom it is averted that Day –[AllŒh] has granted 
him mercy.  And that is the clear attainment.
17.And if AllŒh should touch you with adversity , there is no 
remover of it except Him.  And if He touches you with good –
then He is over all things competent.
18.And He is the subjugator over His servants.  And He is the Wise,
the Acquainted [with all].
                                               
264They would have been destroyed immediately with no chance for repentance.

Page 138:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
11619.Say, "What thing is greatest in testimony?"   Say, "All Œh is witness
between me and you.  And this QurÕ Œn was revealed to me that 
I may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches.265  Do you 
[truly] testify that with All Œh there are other deities?"  Say, "I 
will not testify [with you]."  Say, "Indeed, H e is but one God, 
and indeed, I am free of what you associate [with Him]."
20.Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize it266as 
they recognize their [own] sons.  Those who will lose themselves 
[in the Hereafter] do not believe.
21.And who is mor e unjust than one who invents about All Œh a lie
or denies His verses?  Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.
22.And [mention, O Muúammad ], the Day We will gather them 
all together; then We will say to those who associated others 
with AllŒh, "Where are your 'partners' that you used to claim 
[with Him]?"
23.Then there will be no [excuse upon] examination except they 
will say, "By All Œh, our Lord, we were not those who associated."
24.See how they will lie about themselves.  And lost from them 
will be wh at they used to invent.
25.And among them are those who listen to you,267but We have 
placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and 
in their ears deafness.  And if they should see every sign, they 
will not believe in it.  Even when they come to you arguing 
with you, those who disbelieve say, "This is not but legends of 
the former peoples."
26.And they prevent [others] from him and are [themselves] 
remote from him.  And they do not destroy except themselves, 
but they perceive [it] not.
27.If you could but see when they are made to stand before the 
Fire and will say, "Oh, would that we could be returned [to 
                                               
265At every time and place until the Day of Judgement.266The QurÕ Œn.  Also interpreted as "him," meaning Muúammad ( ).267When you recite the QurÕ Œn.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
117life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among 
the believers."
28.But what they concealed before has [now] appeared tothem.  
And even if they were returned, they would return to that 
which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.
29.And they say, "There is none but our worldly life, and we will 
not be resurrected."
30.If you could but see when they will be made to stand before 
their Lord.  He will say, "Is this not the truth?"  They will say, 
"Yes, by our Lord."  He will [then] say, "So taste the punishment
for what you used to deny ."
31.Those will have lost who deny the meeting with All Œh, until when
the Hour [of resurrection] comes upon them unexpectedly, 
they will say, "Oh, [how great is] our regret over what we 
neglected concerning it [i.e., the Hour]," while they bear their 
burdens [i.e., sins] on their backs.  Unquestionably, evil is that 
which they bear.
32.And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but 
the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear All Œh, so 
will you not reason?
33.We know that you, [O Muúammad ], are saddened by what 
they say.  And indeed, they do not call you untrut hful, but it is 
the verses of All Œh that the wrongdoers reject.
34.And certainly were messengers denied before you, but they were
patient over the denial, and they were harmed until Our victory
came to them.  And none can alter the words [i.e., decrees] o f 
AllŒh.  And there has certainly come to you some information 
about the [previous] messengers.
35.And if their evasion is difficult for you, then if you are able to 
seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring 
them a sign, [then do so ].  But if All Œh had willed, He would 
have united them upon guidance.  So never be of the ignorant.

Page 140:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
11836.Only those who hear will respond.  But the dead268–AllŒh 
will resurrect them; then to Him they will be returned.
37.And they say, "Why has a sign not b een sent down to him from
his Lord?"  Say, "Indeed, AllŒh is Able to send down a sign, 
but most of them do not know."
38.And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies
with its wings except [that they are] communities like you.  
We have not neglected in the Register269a thing.  Then unto 
their Lord they will be gathered.
39.But those who deny Our verses are deaf and dumb within 
darknesses.  Whomever AllŒh wills –He leaves astray; and 
whomever He wills –He puts him on a straight path .
40.Say, "Have you considered:270  if there came to you the 
punishment of AllŒh or there came to you the Hour –is it 
other than All Œh you would invoke, if you should be truthful?"
41.No, it is Him [alone] you would invoke, and He would remove
that for which you invoked Him if He willed, and you would 
forget what you associate [with Him].
42.And We have already sent [messengers] to nations before you, 
[O Muúammad ]; then We seized them with poverty and hardship 
that perhaps they might humble themselves [to Us].
43.Then why, when Our punishment came to them, did they not 
humble themselves?  But their hearts became hardened, and 
Satan made attractive to them that which they were doing.
44.So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded,271
We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, 
when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized 
them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair.
                                               
268i.e., the dea d of heart, meaning the disbelievers.269The Preserved Slate ( al-Lawú al -Maúf´ th), in which all things are recorded.270The meaning is understood to be "Tell me..."271i.e., their trial by poverty and hardship or the warnings of their prophets.

Page 141:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
11945.So the people that committed wrong were eliminated.  And 
praise to All Œh, Lord of the worlds.
46.Say, "Have you considered:272  if All Œh should take away your 
hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, which 
deity other than All Œh could bring them [back] to you?"  Look 
how We diversify273the verses; then they [still] turn away.
47.Say, "Ha ve you considered:  if the punishment of All Œh should
come to you unexpectedly or manifestly,274will any be destroyed 
but the wrongdoing people?"
48.And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good 
tidings and warners.  So whoever believes and ref orms –there 
will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
49.But those who deny Our verses –the punishment will touch275
them for their defiant disobedience.
50.Say, [O Muúammad ], "I do not tell you that I have the 
depositories [containing the p rovision] of All Œh or that I know 
the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel.  I only follow 
what is revealed to me."  Say, "Is the blind equivalent to the 
seeing?  Then will you not give thought?"
51.And warn by it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] those who fear that they will be 
gathered before their Lord –for them besides Him will be no
protector and no intercessor –that they might become righteous.
52.And do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning
and afternoon, seeking His countenance.  Not upon you is 
anything of their account and not upon them is an ything of 
your account.276  So were you to send them away, you would 
[then] be of the wrongdoers.
                                               
272See footnote to verse 40.273Repeat in various ways for emphasis and clarification.274i.e., before your eyes.275i.e., reach and afflict.276No one is held accountable for the deeds or intentions of another.  That is 
left to All Œh's judgement.

Page 142:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
12053.And thus We have tried some of them through others that they 
[i.e., the disbelievers] might say, "Is it these whom AllŒh has 
favored among us?"  Is not All Œh most knowing of those who 
are grateful?277
54.And when those come to you who believe in Our verses, say, 
"Peace be upon you.  Your Lord has decreed upon Himself mercy:   
that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then 
repents after that and corrects himself –indeed, He is 
Forgiving and Merciful."
55.And thus do We detail the verses, and [thus] the way of the 
criminals will become evident.
56.Say, "Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you 
invoke besides AllŒh."  Say, "I will not follow your desires, 
for I would then have gone astray, and I would not be of the 
[rightly] guided."
57.Say, "Indeed, I am on clear evidence from my Lord, and you 
have denied it.  I do not have that for which you are impatient .278  
The decision is only for All Œh.  He relates the truth, and He is 
the best of deciders."
58.Say, "If I had that for which you are impatient, the matter 
would have been decided between me and you, but AllŒh is 
most knowing of the wrongdoers."
59.And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them
except Him.  And He knows what is on the land and in the sea.   
Not a leaf falls but that He knows it.  And no grain is there 
within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [t hing] 
but that it is [written] in a clear record.
                                               
277Those referred to in verses 52-54are the poor Muslims who were sincere 
believers and students of the Prophet ().  The influential leaders of 
Quraysh had disdained to sit with them, saying to Prophet Muúammad (), 
"Perhaps if you evicted them, we would follow you."278The disbelievers would challenge the Prophet (), telling him to bring 
on All Œh's punishment if he should be truthful in his warning.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
12160.And it is He who takes your souls by night279and knows what 
you have committed by day.  Then He revives you therein 
[i.e., by day] that a specified term280may be fulfilled.  Then to 
Him will be your retur n; then He will inform you about what 
you used to do.
61.And He is the subjugator over His servants, and He sends over 
you guardian -angels until, when death comes to one of you, 
Our messengers [i.e., angels of death] take him, and they do 
not fail [in the ir duties].
62.Then they [i.e., His servants] are returned to All Œh, their true Lord.   
Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest 
of accountants.
63.Say, "Who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea
[when] you call upon Him imploring [aloud] and privately, 'If 
He should save us from this [crisis], we will surely be among 
the thankful. '"
64.Say, "It is All Œh who saves you from it and from every distress;
then you [still] associate others with Him."
65.Say, "He is the [one] A ble to send upon you affliction from above 
you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you [so you become] 
sects281and make you taste the violence of one another."  
Look how We diversify the signs that they might understand.
66.But your people have denied it while it is the truth.  Say, "I am 
not over you a manager [i.e., authority]."
67.For every news [i.e., happening] is a finality;282and you are 
going to know.
68.And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse283
concerning Our verses, then turn away from them until they 
                                               
279i.e., when you sleep.280One's decreed life span.281Following your own inclinations rather than the truth, biased and hostile 
toward each other.282Other shades of meaning include "a permanence," "a realization" and "a 
time of stability."283i.e., denials or mockery.

122enter into another conversation.  And if Satan should cause 
you to forget, then do not remain after the reminder with the 
wrongdoing people.
69.And those who fear AllŒh are not held accountable for them 
[i.e., the disbelievers] at all, but [only for] a reminder –that 
perhaps they will fear Him.
70.And leave those who take their religion as amusement and 
diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded.  But remind 
with it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn], lest a soul be given up to destructi on 
for what it earned; it will have other than AllŒh no protector 
and no intercessor.  And if it should offer every compensation, 
it would not be taken from it [i.e., that soul].  Those are the 
ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned.  
For them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful 
punishment because they used to disbelieve.
71.Say, "Shall we invoke instead of AllŒh that which neither 
benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after 
AllŒh has guided us?  [We woul d then be] like one whom the 
devils enticed [to wander] upon the earth confused, [while] he 
has companions inviting him to guidance, [calling], 'Come to 
us.'"284  Say, "Indeed, the guidance of AllŒh is the [only] 
guidance; and we have been commanded to submi t to the 
Lord of the worlds
72.And to establish prayer and fear Him."  And it is He to whom 
you will be gathered.
73.And it is He who created the heavens and earth in truth.  And 
the day [i.e., whenever] He says, "Be," and it is, His word is 
the truth.285And His is the dominion [on] the Day the Horn is 
                                               
284The example given is of one who has lost his way and is further confused 
by the evil ones who tempt him to follow various directions, all leading to 
destruction.  Although his sincere friends call him back to the right path, 
heignores them.285When interpreted as the "Day" (of resurrection), the sentence would read:  
"And the Day He says, 'Be,' and it is, His word will be the truth."

123blown.  [He is] Knower of the unseen286and the witnessed;287
and He is the Wise, the Acquainted.
74.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Abraham said to his 
father zar, "Do you take idols as deities?  Indeed, I see you 
and your people to be in manifest error."
75.And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and 
the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith].
76.So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star.  
He said, "This is my lord."288  But when it set, he said, "I like 
not those that set [i.e., disappear]."
77.And when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my lord."  
But when it set, he said, "Unless my Lord guides me, I will 
surely be among the people gone astray."
78.And when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my lord; this 
is greater."  But when it set, he said, "O my people, indeed I 
am free from what you associate with All Œh.
79.Indeed, I have turned my face [i.e., self] toward He who created
the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not 
of those who associate others with All Œh."
80.And his people argued with him.  He said, "Do you argue with 
me concerning All Œhwhile He has guided me?  And I fear not 
what you associate with Him [and will not be harmed] unless 
my Lord should will something.  My Lord encompasses all 
things in knowledge; then will you not remember?
81.And how should I fear what you associate while you do not 
                                               
286That w hich is absent, invisible, or beyond the perception of the senses or 
of the mind and therefore is unknown to man, except for what AllŒh 
chooses to reveal.287What is present, visible and known to man.  The knowledge of AllŒh 
(subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) includes th e reality of all things and all occurrences,
no matter how they might appear to human beings.288In verses 76-79, beginning from the people 's own assertions , Abraham 
presents a picture of his dissatisfaction as the only logical conclusion one could
reach, in order to show them the futility of their false objects of worship.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
124fear that you have associated with All Œh that for which He has 
not sent down to you any authority?  So which of the two 
parties has more right to security, if you should know?"
82.They who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice289–
those will have security, and they are [rightly] guided.
83.And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave
Abraham against his people.  We raise by degrees whom We will.  
Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.
84.And We gave to him [i.e., Abraham] Isaac and Jacob –all [of 
them] We guided.  And Noah, We guided before; and among 
his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and 
Moses and Aaron.  Thus do We reward the doers of good.
85.And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias –and all were of 
the righteous.
86.And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot –and all [of them] 
We preferred over the worlds.
87.And [some] among their fathers and their descendants and 
their brothers –and We chose them and We guided them to a 
straight path.
88.That is the guidance of AllŒh by which He guides whomever 
He wills of His servants.  But if they had associated others 
with AllŒh, then worthless for them would be whatever they 
were doing.
89.Those are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture and 
authority and prophethood.  But if they [i.e., the disbelievers] 
deny it, then We have entrusted it to a people who are not 
therein disbelievers.
90.Those are the ones whom AllŒh has guided, so from their 
guidance take an example.  Say, "I ask of you for it [i.e., this 
message] no payment.  It is not but a reminder for the worlds."
                                               
289Specifically, the association of others in divinity with All Œh.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 7
12591.And they did not appraise AllŒh with true appraisal290when 
they said, "AllŒh did not reveal to a human being anything."  
Say, "Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light 
and guidance to the people?  You [Jews] make it into pages, 
disclosing [some of] it and concealing much.  And you291were 
taught that which you knew not –neither you nor your fathers."   
Say, "AllŒh [revealed it]."  Then leave them in their [empty] 
discourse, am using themselves.
92.And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed and 
confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother 
of Cities [i.e., Makkah] and those around it.292  Those who 
believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are maintai ning 
their prayers.
93.And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about 
AllŒh or says, "It has been inspired to me," while nothing has 
been inspired to him, and one who says, "I will reveal 
[something] like what AllŒh revealed."  And if you could b ut 
see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of 
death while the angels extend their hands,293[saying], 
"Discharge your souls!  Today you will be awarded the 
punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say 
against All Œh other than th e truth and [that] you were, toward 
His verses, being arrogant."
94.[It will be said to them], "And you have certainly come to Us 
alone [i.e., individually] as We created you the first time, and 
you have left whatever We bestowed upon you behind you.  
And We do not see with you your 'intercessors' which you 
claimed that they were among you associates [of AllŒh].  It 
has [all] been severed between you,294and lost from you is 
what you used to claim."
                                               
290i.e., they did not appreciate the extent of His ability and wisdom.291The Jews, or it may refer to the believers, who are t aught by the QurÕ Œn.292i.e., all other peoples.293Striking them, as they are unwilling to give up their souls for judgement.294Between yourselves and the claimed associates and intercessors.

12695.Indeed, AllŒh is the cleaver of grain and date seeds.295  He 
brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the 
living.  That is All Œh; so how are you deluded?
96.[He is] the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest 
and the sun and moon for calculation.296  That is the determination
of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
97.And it is He who placed for you the stars that you may be 
guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea.  
We have detailed the signs for a people who know.
98.And it is He who produced you from one soul and [gave you] 
a place of dwelling and of storage.297  We have detailed the 
signs for a people who understand.
99.And it is H e who sends down rain from the sky, and We 
produce thereby the growth of all things.  We produce from it 
greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers.  
And from the palm trees –of its emerging fruit are clusters 
hanging low.  And [We produce] gardens of grapevines and 
olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied.  Look at [each of] 
its fruit when it yields and [at] its ri pening.  Indeed in that are 
signs for a people who believe.
100.But they have attributed to All Œh partners –the jinn, while He 
has created them –and have fabricated for Him sons and 
daughters.   Exalted is He and high above what they describe.
101.[He is] Originator of the heavens and the earth.  How could 
He have a son when He does not have a companion [i.e., wife] 
and He created all things?  And He is, of all things, Knowing.
102.That is All Œh, your Lord; there is no deity except Him, the 
Creator of a ll things, so worship Him.  And He is Disposer of 
all things.
                                               
295He (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) causes them to split and sprout.296Or "acco rding to calculation," referring to their precise movement.297In the earth .  See 77:25 -26.

127103.Vision perceives Him not,298but He perceives [all] vision; and 
He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.
104.There has come to you enlightenment from your Lord.  So 
whoever will see does so for [the benefit of] his soul, and 
whoever is blind [does harm] against it.  And [say], "I am not 
a guardian over you."299
105.And thus do We diversify the verses so they [i.e., the 
disbelievers] will say, "You have studied,"300and so We may 
make it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] clear for a people who know.
106.Follow, [O Muúammad ], what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord –there is no deity except Him –and turn away 
from those who associate others with All Œh.
107.But if All Œh had willed, they would not have associated .  And 
We have not appointed you over them as a guardian, nor are 
you a manager over them.301
108.And do not insult those they invoke other than All Œh, lest they 
insult AllŒh in enmity without knowledge.  Thus We have 
made pleasing to every community their deeds.  Then to their 
Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they 
used to do.
109.And they swear by AllŒh their strongest oaths that if a sign
came to them, they would surely believe in it.  Say, "The signs 
are only with [i.e., from] AllŒh."  And what will make you
perceive that even if it [i.e., a sign] came, they would not believe.
110.And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they 
refused to believe in it [i.e., the revelation] the first time.  And
We will leave them i n their transgression, wandering blindly.
                                               
298In the life of this world.  The people of Paradise will be able to see All Œh 
in the Hereafter .  See 75:22 -23.299The Prophet () is directed to disassociate himself from all erroneous 
belief and practice.300Accusing the Prophet ()of having learned from the Jews and Christians.301The Prophet's duty did not go beyond delivery of the message.

Page 150:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
128111.And even if We had sent down to them the angels [with the 
message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gathered 
together every [created] thing in front of them, they would not 
believe unless All Œh shoul d will.  But most of them, [of that],
are ignorant.
112.And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy –devils 
from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative 
speech in delusion.  But if your Lord had willed, they would 
not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.
113.And [it is] so the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter
will incline toward it [i.e., deceptive speech] and that they will
be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they 
are committing.
114.[Say], "Then is it other than All Œh I should seek as judge while
it is He who has revealed to you the Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] 
explained in detail?"  And those to whom We [previously] 
gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in 
truth, so never be among the doubters.
115.And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in 
justice.  None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the 
Knowing.
116.And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead
you from the w ay of All Œh.  They follow not except assumption,
and they are not but falsifying.302
117.Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who strays from His way,
and He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.
118.So eat of that [meat] upon which the name of AllŒh has been 
mentioned,303if you are believers in His verses [i.e., revealed 
law].
119.And why should you not eat of that upon which the name of 
AllŒh has been mentioned while He has explained in detail to 
                                               
302Out of ignorance, conjecture and supposition.303At the time of slaughter.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
129you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you 
are compelled.304  And indeed do many lead [others] astray 
through their [own] inclinations without knowledge.  Indeed, 
your Lord –He is most knowing of the transgressors.
120.And leave [i.e., desist from] what is apparent of sin and what 
is concealed thereof.  Indeed, those who earn [blame for] sin 
will be recompensed for that which they used to commit.
121.And do not eat of that upon which the name of AllŒh has not 
been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience.  And 
indeed do the devils inspire their allies [among men] to 
dispute with you.  And if you were to obey them, indeed, you 
would be associators [of others with Him].305
122.And is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for 
him light by which to walk among the people like one who is
in darkness, never to emerge therefrom?  Thus it has been 
made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing.
123.And thus We have placed within every city the greatest of its 
criminals to conspire therein.  But they conspire not except 
against themselves, and they perceive [it] not.
124.And when a sign comes to them, they say, "Never will we 
believe until we are given like that which was given to the 
messengers of AllŒh."  AllŒh is most knowing of where [i.e., 
with whom] He places His message.   There will afflict those 
who committed crimes debasement before AllŒh and severe 
punishment for what they used to conspire.
125.So whoever AllŒh wants to guide –He expands his breast to 
[contain] IslŒm; and whoever He wants to misguide306–He 
makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing
into the sky.  Thus does AllŒh place defilement upon those 
who do not believe.
                                               
304In cas es of dire necessity, what is normally prohibited becomes permissible,
but only to the extent of the need.305i.e., by your obedience to them –obedience being the basis of worship.306As a result of the person's arrogance and persistence in sin.

S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
130126.And this is the path of your Lord, [leading] straight.  We have 
detailed the verses for a people who remember.
127.For them will be the Home of Peace [i.e., Paradise] with their 
Lord.  And He will be their protecting friend because of what 
they used to do.
128.And [mention, O Muúammad ], the Day when He will gather 
them together [and say], "O company of jinn, you have 
[misled] many of mankind."  And their allies among mankind 
will say, "Our Lord, some of us made use of others, and we 
have [now] reached our term which You appointed for us."  
He will say, "The Fire is your residence, wherein you will 
abide eternally, except for what AllŒh wills.  Indeed, your 
Lord is Wise and Knowing."
129.And thus will We make some of the wrongdoers allies of 
others for what they used to earn.307
130."O company of jinn and mankind,308did there not come to you 
messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and 
warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?"  They will 
say, "We bear witness against ourselves"; and the worldly life 
had deluded them, and they will bear witness against themselves
that they were disbelievers.
131.That isbecause your Lord would not destroy the cities for 
wrongdoing309while their people were unaware.
132.And for all are degrees [i.e., positions resulting] from what they 
have done.  And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.
133.And your Lord is the Fre e of need, the possessor of mercy.  If 
He wills, He can do away with you and give succession after 
you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the 
descendants of another people.
                                               
307Another inte rpretation pertaining to this world is "And thus do We make 
some of the wrongdoers allies of others for what they have been earning."308They will be reproached thus at the Judgement.309Or "unjustly."

Page 153:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
131134.Indeed, what you are promised is coming, and you will not 
cause failure [to All Œh].310
135.Say, "O my people, work according to your position; [for] 
indeed, I am working.  And you are going to know who will 
have succession in the home.311  Indeed, the wrongdoers will 
not succeed."
136.And they [i.e., the polytheists] a ssign to All Œh from that which 
He created of crops and livestock a share and say, "This is 
for AllŒh," by their claim, "and this is for our 'partners'
[associated with Him]."  But what is for their "partners" does 
not reach AllŒh, while what is for AllŒh –this reaches their 
"partners."  Evil is that which they rule.
137.And likewise, to many of the polytheists their partners312have 
made [to seem] pleasing the killing of their children in order to
bring about their destruction and to cover them with confus ion
in their religion.  And if AllŒh had willed, they would not 
have done so.  So leave them and that which they invent.
138.And they say, "These animals313and crops are forbidden; no 
one may eat from them except whom we will," by their claim.   
And there are those [camels] whose backs are forbidden [by 
them]314and those upon which the name of AllŒh is not 
mentioned315–[all of this] an invention of untruth about 
Him.316  He will punish them for what they were inventing.
139.And they say, "What is in the bellie s of these animals317is 
exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females.  But if 
it is [born] dead, then all of them have shares therein."  He 
                                               
310i.e., You will neither escape nor prevent its occurrence.311i.e., in the land or in the Hereafter.312Their evil associates.313The four categories of grazing livestock called " anÔŒm " collectively.314See 5:103 .315At the time of slaughter.  Rather, they are dedicated to others among their 
"deities."316i.e., false asserti ons that such practices are part of All Œh's religion.317i.e., their milk and offspring.

Page 154:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
132will punish them for their description.318  Indeed, He is Wise 
and Knowing.
140.Those will have lost who killed their children in foolishness 
without knowledge and prohibited what AllŒh had provided 
for them, inventing untruth about AllŒh.  They have gone 
astray and were not [rightly] guided.
141.And He it is who causes gardens to grow, [both] trellised and 
untrellised, and palm trees and crops of different [kinds of] 
food and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar.  Eat 
of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zak Œh] on 
the day of its harvest.  And be not excessive.319  Indeed, He 
does not like those who commit excess.
142.And of the grazing livestock are carriers [of burdens] and 
those [too] small.  Eat of what AllŒh has provided for you 
and do not follow the footsteps of Satan.320  Indeed, he is to 
you a clear enemy.
143.[They are] eight mates –of the sheep, two and of the goats, 
two.  Say, "Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two 
females or that which the wombs of the two females contain?  
Inform me with knowledge, if you should be truthful."
144.And of the camels, two and of the cattle, two.  Say, "Is it the 
two males He has forbidden or the two females or that which 
the wombs of the two females contain?  Or were you 
witnesses when AllŒh charged you with this?  Then who is 
more unjust than one who invents a lie about All Œh to m islead 
the people by [something] other than knowledge?  Indeed, 
AllŒh does not guide the wrongdoing people."
145.Say, "I do not find within that which was revealed to me 
[anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a 
dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine –for
                                               
318Of what is lawful and unlawful according to their whims.319In eating, as well as in all things generally.320As the disbelievers have done in making their own rulings abou t what is 
permissible and what is prohibited.

Page 155:
S´rah 6–al-AnÔŒm JuzÕ 8
133indeed, it is impure –or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience,
dedicated to other than AllŒh.321  But whoever is forced [by 
necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], 
then indeed, your Lord is Fo rgiving and Merciful."
146.And to those who are Jews We prohibited every animal of 
uncloven hoof; and of the cattle and the sheep We prohibited 
to them their fat, except what adheres to their backs or the 
entrails or what is joined with bone.  [By] that W e repaid them 
for their injustice.  And indeed, We are truthful.
147.So if they deny you, [O Muúammad ], say, "Your Lord is the 
possessor of vast mercy; but His punishment cannot be repelled
from the people who are criminals."
148.Those who associated with AllŒh will say, "If AllŒh had 
willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither 
would our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything."  
Likewise did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment.   
Say, "Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for 
us?  You follow not except assumption, and you are not but 
falsifying."
149.Say, "With All Œh is the far -reaching [i.e., conclusive] argument.   
If He had willed, He would have guided you all."
150.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Bring forward your witnesses who will 
testify that AllŒh has prohibited this."  And if they testify, do
not testify with them.  And do not follow the desires of those 
who deny Our verses and those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, while they equate [others] with their Lor d.
151.Say, "Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to 
you.  [He commands] that you not associate anything with 
Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your  
children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them.  
And do not app roach immoralities –what is apparent of them 
and what is concealed.  And do not kill the soul which AllŒh

He instructed you that you may use reason."
152.And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way 
that is best [i.e., intending improvement] until he reaches 
maturity.  And give full measure and weight in justice.  We do 
not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity.  
And when you speak [i.e., testify], be just, even if [it concerns]
a near relative.  And the covenant of All Œh fulfill.  This has He 
instructed you that you may remember.
153.And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it;
and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from
His way.  This has He instructed you that you may become 
righteous.
154.Then322We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our 
favor] upon the one who did good [i.e., Moses] and as a 
detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy 
that perh aps in the meeting with their Lord they would believe.
155.And this [QurÕ Œn] is a Book We have revealed [which is] blessed, 
so follow it and fear All Œh that you may receive mercy.
156.[We revealed it] lest you say, "The Scripture was only sent down 
to tw o groups before us, but we were of their study unaware,"
157.Or lest you say, "If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, 
we would have been better guided than they."  So there has 
[now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a 
guidance and m ercy.  Then who is more unjust than one who 
denies the verses of AllŒh and turns away from them?  We 
will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with 
the worst of punishment for their having turned away.
158.Do they [then] wait for anything except that the angels should 
come to them or your Lord should come or that there come 
some of the signs323of your Lord?  The Day that some of the

135signs of your Lord will come no soul will benefit from its 
faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned
through its faith some good.  Say, "Wait.  Indeed, we [also] 
are waiting."
159.Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become 
sects –you, [O Muúammad ], are not [associated] with them in 
anything.  Their affair is only [left] to AllŒh; then He will 
inform them about what they used to do.
160.Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed 
will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and 
whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed 
except the like thereof; and they w ill not be wronged.324
161.Say, "Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path –a 
correct religion –the way of Abraham, inclining toward truth.   
And he was not among those who associated others with All Œh."
162.Say, "Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and 
my dying are for All Œh, Lord of the worlds.
163.No partner has He.  And this I have been commanded, and I 
am the first [among you] of the Muslims."325
164.Say, "Is it other than All Œh I should desire as a lord while He 
is the Lord of all things?  And every soul earns not [blame] 
except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the 
burden of another.  Then to your Lord is your return, and He 
will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ."
165.And it is He who h as made you successors upon the earth and 
has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that 
He may try you through what He has given you.  Indeed, your 
Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and 
Merciful.

2.[This is] a Book revealed to you, [O Muúammad ] –so let 
there not be in your breast distress therefrom –that you may 
warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers.
3.Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies.  Little 
do you remember.
4.And how many cities have We destroyed, and Our punishment
came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon.
5.And their declaration when O ur punishment came to them was 
only that they said, "Indeed, we were wrongdoers!"
6.Then We will surely question those to whom [a message] was 
sent, and We will surely question the messengers.
7.Then We will surely relate [their deeds] to them with kno wledge,
and We were not [at all] absent.
8.And the weighing [of deeds] that Day will be the truth.  So those 
whose scales are heavy –it is they who will be the successful.
9.And those whose scales are light –they are the ones who will lose 
themselves for what injustice they were doing toward Our verses.
10.And We have certainly established you upon the earth and made
for you therein ways of livelihood.  Little are you grateful.
11.And We have certainly created you, [O mankind], and given 
you [human] form.  Then We said to the angels, "Prostrate to 
Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees.328  He was not of 
those who prostrated.

13712.[AllŒh] said, "What prevented you from prostrating when I 
commanded you?"  [Satan] said, "I am better than him.  You 
created me from fire and created him from clay [i.e., earth]."
13.[AllŒh] said, "Descend from it [i.e., Paradise], for it is not for 
you to be arrogant therein.  So get out; indeed, you are of the 
debased."
14.[Satan] said, "Reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."
15.[AllŒh] said, "Indeed, you are of those reprieved."
16.[Satan] said, "Because You have put me in error, I will surely 
sit in wait for them [i.e., mankind] on Your straight path.
17.Then I will come to them from before them and from behind 
them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find 
most of them grateful [to You]."
18.[AllŒh] said, "Depart from it [i.e., Paradise], reproached and 
expelled.  Whoever follows you among them –I will surely 
fill Hell with you, all t ogether."
19.And "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat 
from wherever you will but do not approach this tree, lest you 
be among the wrongdoers."
20.But Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that
which was concealed from them of their private parts.  He said,
"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become
angels or become of the immortal."
21.And he swore [by AllŒh] to them, "Indeed, I am to you from 
among the sincere advisors."
22.So he made them fall, through deception.  And when they tasted
of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and 
they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves 
of Paradise.  And their Lord called to them, "Did I not forbid 
you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?"
23.They said, "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You 
do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be 
among the losers."

13824.[AllŒh] said, "Descend, being to one another enemies.  And 
for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment 
[i.e., provision] for a time."
25.He said, "Therein you will live, and therein you will die, and 
from it you will be brought forth."
26.O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to 
conceal your priv ate parts and as adornment.  But the clothing 
of righteousness –that is best.  That is from the signs of All Œh 
that perhaps they will remember.
27.O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed 
your parents from Paradise, stripping them of the ir clothing329
to show them their private parts.  Indeed, he sees you, he and 
his tribe, from where you do not see them.  Indeed, We have 
made the devils allies to those who do not believe.
28.And when they commit an immorality, they say, "We found 
our fathers doing it, and AllŒh has ordered us to do it."  Say, 
"Indeed, AllŒh does not order immorality.  Do you say about 
AllŒh that which you do not know?"
29.Say, [O Muúammad ], "My Lord has ordered justice and that 
you direct yourselves [to the Qiblah ] at every place [or time] 
of prostration, and invoke Him, sincere to Him in religion."  
Just as He originated you, you will return [to life] –
30.A group [of you] He guided, and a group deserved [to be in]
error.  Indeed, they [i.e., the latter] had taken the de vils as allies 
instead of All Œh while they thought that they were guided.
31.O children of Adam, take your adornment [i.e., wear your 
clothing] at every masjid,330and eat and drink, but be not 
excessive.  Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.
32.Say, "Who has forbidden the adornment of [i.e., from] AllŒh 
which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful]

139things of provision?"  Say, "They are for those who believe 
during worldly life [but] exclusively for them on the Day of 
Resurrection." Thus do We detail the verses for a people who 
know.
33.Say, "My Lord has only forbidden immoralities –what is apparent
of them and what is concealed –and sin,331and oppression 
without right, and that you associate with All Œh that for which 
He has not se nt down authority, and that you say about All Œh 
that which you do not know."
34.And for every nation is a [specified] term.  So when their time 
has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they 
precede [it].
35.O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from
among you relating to you My verses [i.e., scriptures and laws],
then whoever fears AllŒh and reforms –there will be no fear 
concerning them, nor will they grieve.
36.But the ones who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward 
them –those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide 
therein eternally.
37.And who is more unjust than one who invents about AllŒh a 
lie or denies His verses?  Those will attain their portion of the 
decree332until, when Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to 
them to take them in death, they will say, "Where are those 
you used to invoke besides All Œh?"  They will say, "They have 
departed from us," and will bear witness against themselves 
thatthey were disbelievers.
38.[AllŒh] will say, "Enter among natio ns which had passed on 
before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire."  Every time a 
nation enters, it will curse its sister333until, when they have all 
overtaken one another therein, the last of them334will say 
                                               
331Any unlawful deed.332What is decreed for them.333The nation preceding it.334The followers of evil leaders.

140about the first of them,335"Our Lord, these had misled us, so 
give them a double punishment of the Fire."  He will say, "For 
each is double, but you do not know."
39.And the first of them will say to the last of them, "Then you 
had not any favor over us, so taste the punishment for what 
you used to ear n."
40.Indeed, those who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward 
them –the gates of Heaven will not be opened for them, nor 
will they enter Paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a 
needle [i.e., never].  And thus do We recompense the criminals.
41.They will have from Hell a bed and over them coverings [of 
fire].  And thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.
42.But those who believed and did righteous deeds –We charge 
no soul except [within] its capacity.  Those are the companions 
of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.
43.And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of 
resentment,336[while] flowing beneath them are rivers.  And 
they will say, "Praise to All Œh, who has guided us to this; and 
we would never have been guided if All Œh had not guided us.  
Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth."   
And they will be called, "This is Paradise, which you have 
been made to inherit for what you used to do."
44.And the companions of Paradise will call out to the compani ons 
of the Fire, "We have already found what our Lord promised 
us to be true.  Have you found what your Lord promised to be 
true?"  They will say, "Yes."  Then an announcer will announce
among them, "The curse of All Œh shall be upon the wrongdoers
45.Who averted [people] from the way of AllŒh and sought to make 
it [seem] deviant while they were, concerning the Hereafter,
disbelievers."

14146.And between them will be a partition [i.e., wall], and on [its] 
elevations are men337who recognize all338by their mark. And 
they call out to the companions of Paradise, "Peace be upon you."   
They have not [yet] entered it, but they long intensely.
47.And when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the
Fire, they say, "Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoing
people."
48.And the companions of the Elevations will call to men [within 
Hell] whom they recognize by their mark, saying, "Of no avail to 
you was your gathering339and [the fact] that you were arrogant."
49.[AllŒh will say], "Are these340the ones whom you [inhabitants 
of Hell] swore that All Œh would never offer them mercy?  Enter
Paradise, [O people of the Elevations].  No fear will there be 
concerning you, nor will you grieve."
50.And the companions of the Fire will call to the companions of 
Paradise, "Po ur upon us some water or from whatever All Œh has
provided you."  They will say, "Indeed, AllŒh has forbidden 
them both to the disbelievers
51.Who took their religion as distraction and amusement and 
whom the worldly life deluded."  So today We will forget
them just as they forgot the meeting of this Day of theirs and 
for having rejected Our verses.
52.And We had certainly brought them a Book which We detailed
by knowledge –as guidance and mercy to a people who believe.
53.Do they await except its result ?341  The Day its result comes 
those who had ignored it before will say, "The messengers of 
our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any 
intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do 
                                               
337Those whose scales are balanced between good and evil deeds.338Both the inhabitants of Paradise and those of Hell.339i.e., great numbers or gathering of wealth.340The humble believers who are now in Paradise.  Another interpretation 
regards them as the peop le on the elevated partition.341The fulfillment of what is promised in the QurÕ Œn.

142other than what we used to do?"  They will ha ve lost themselves,
and lost from them is what they used to invent.
54.Indeed, your Lord is All Œh, who created the heavens and earth 
in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.342  
He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it 
rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, 
subjected by His command.  Unquestionably, His is the creation
and the command; blessed is All Œh, Lord of the worlds.
55.Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He 
does not like tr ansgressors.343
56.And cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation.  
And invoke Him in fear and aspiration.  Indeed, the mercy of 
AllŒh is near to the doers of good.
57.And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His 
mercy [i.e., rainfall] until, when they have carried heavy 
rainclouds, We drive them to a dead land and We send down 
rain therein and bring forth thereby [some] of all the fruits.  
Thus will We bring forth the dead; perhaps you may be reminded.
58.And the good land –its vegetation emerges by permission of its 
Lord; but that which is bad –nothing emerges except sparsely,
with difficulty.  Thus do We diversify the signs for a people 
who are grateful.
59.We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, "O my 
peop le, worship AllŒh; you have no deity other than Him.  
Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day."
60.Said the eminent among his people, "Indeed, we see you in 
clear error."
61.[Noah] said, "O my people, there is not error in me, but I am a 
messenger from the Lord of the worlds.
62.I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you; and 
I know from All Œh what you do not know.

14363.Then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from 
your Lord through a man from among you, that he may warn 
you and that you may fear All Œh so you might receive mercy?"
64.But they denied him, so We saved him and those who were with 
him in the ship.  And We drowned those who denied Our signs.   
Indeed, they were a blind people.344
65.And to the ÔAad [ We sent] their brother H´d.  He said, "O my 
people, worship AllŒh; you have no deity other than Him.  
Then will you not fear Him?"
66.Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, 
"Indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you 
are of the liars."
67.[H´d] said, "O my people, there is not foolishness in me, but I 
am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.
68.I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I am to you a 
trustworthy adviser.
69.Then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from 
your Lord through a man from among you, that he may warn 
you?  And remember when He made you successors after the 
people of Noah and increased you in stature extensively.  So 
remember the favors of All Œh that you might succeed."
70.They said, "Have you come to us that we should worship All Œh
alone and leave what our fathers have worshipped?  Then bring
us what you promise us,345if you should be of the truthful."
71.[H´d] said, "Already have defilement and anger fallen upon 
you from your Lord.  Do you dispute with me concerning 
[mere] names you have named them,346you and your fathers, 
for which All Œh has not sent down any authority?  Then wait; 
indeed, I am with you among those who wait."
72.So We saved him and those with him by mercy fr om Us.  And 
                                               
344For a more detailed account , see 11:25 -48.345i.e., All Œh's punishment.346The false objects of worship which you have call ed "gods."

S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 8
144We eliminated those who denied Our signs, and they were not 
[at all] believers.
73.And to the Tham´d [We sent] their brother êŒliú.  He said, "O 
my people, worship All Œh; you have no deity other than Him.  
There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord.  This is 
the she -camel of All Œh [sent] to you as a sign.  So leave her to 
eat within AllŒh's land and do not touch her with harm, lest 
there seize you a painful punishment.
74.And remember when He made you successors after the ÔAad 
and settled you in the land, [and] you take for yourselves 
palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains, homes.  
Then remember the favors of AllŒh and do not commit abuse 
on the earth, spreading corruption."
75.Said the eminent ones who were arrogant amo ng his people to 
those who were oppressed –to those who believed among them,
"Do you [actually] know that êŒliú is sent from his Lord?"  
They said, "Indeed we, in that with which he was sent, are 
believers."
76.Said those who were arrogant, "Indeed we, in that which you 
have believed, are disbelievers."
77.So they hamstrung the she -camel and were insolent toward the 
command of their Lord and said, "O êŒliú, bring us what you 
promise us, if you should be of the messengers."
78.So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their 
home [corpses] fallen prone.
79.And he [i.e., êŒliú] turned away from them and said, "O my 
people, I had certainly conveyed to you the message of my 
Lord and advised you, but you do not like advisors."
80.And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, "Do you 
commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with 
from among the worlds [i.e., peoples]?
81.Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women.  
Rather, you are a transgressing people."

Page 167:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
14582.But the answe r of his people was only that they said, "Evict them 
from your city!  Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure."
83.So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was 
of those who remained [with the evildoers].
84.And We rained upon them arain [of stones].  Then see how 
was the end of the criminals.
85.And to [the people of] Madyan [We sent] their brother ShuÔayb.   
He said, "O my people, worship All Œh; you have no deity other 
than Him.  There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord.   
So fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of 
their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its 
reformation.  That is better for you, if you should be believers.
86.And do not sit on every path, threatening and averting from 
the way of All Œh those who believe in Him, seeking to make it 
[seem] deviant.  And remember when you were few and He 
increased you.  And see how was the end of the corrupters.
87.And if there should be a group among you who has believed 
in that with which I have been sent and a group that has not 
believed, then be patient until AllŒh judges between us.  And 
He is the best of judges."
88.Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people, 
"We will surely evict you, O ShuÔayb, and those who have 
believ ed with you from our city, or you must return to our 
religion."   He said, "Even if we were unwilling?
89.We would have invented against AllŒh a lie if we returned to 
your religion after AllŒh had saved us from it.  And it is not 
for us to return to it except that AllŒh, our Lord, should will.  
Our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge.  Upon AllŒh
we have relied.  Our Lord, decide between us and our people 
in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision."
90.Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, "If 
you should follow ShuÔayb, indeed, you would then be losers."
91.So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their 
home [corpses] fallen prone.

14692.Those who denied ShuÔayb –it was as though they had never 
resided there.  Those who denied ShuÔayb –it was they who 
were the losers.
93.And he [i.e., ShuÔayb] turned away from them and said, "O my 
people, I had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my
Lord and advised you, so how could I grieve for a disbelieving
people?"
94.And We sent to no city a prophet [who was denied] except 
that We seized its people with poverty and hardship that they 
might humble themselves [to All Œh].
95.Then We exchanged in place of the bad [condition], good, 
until they increased [and prospered] and said, "Our fathers 
[also] were touched with hardship and ease."347  So We seized 
them suddenly while they did not perceive.348
96.And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared All Œh,
We would have opened [i.e., bestowed] upon them blessings from
the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so 
We seized them for what they were earning.349
97.Then, did the people of the cities feel secure from Our punishment 
coming to them at night while they were asleep?
98.Or did the people of the cities feel secure from Our punishment
coming to them in the morning while they were at play?350
99.Then, did they feel secure from the plan of All Œh?  But no one 
feels secure from the plan of All Œh except the losing people.
100.Has i t not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its
[previous] people that if We willed, We could afflict them for 
their sins?  But We seal over their hearts so they do not hear.351
                                               
347Instead of being grateful to All Œh for His blessings, they merely attributed 
them to the changing fortunes of time.348That they had been tried and tested.349Of blame for their sin.350i.e., occupied with such activities that have no benefit.351They do not benefit from what they hear.

147101.Those cities –We relate to you, [O Muúammad ], some of 
their news.  And certainly did their messengers come to them 
with clear proofs, but they were not to believe in that which 
they had denied before.352  Thus does AllŒh seal over the 
hearts of the disbelievers.
102.And We did not find for most of them any covenant;353but 
indeed, We found most of them defiantly disobedient.
103.Then We sent after them Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh 
and his establishment, but they were unjust toward them.354  
So see how was the end of the corrupters.
104.And Moses said, "O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord 
of the worlds
105.[Who is] obligated not to say about AllŒh except the truth.  I 
have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord, so send 
with me the Children of Israel."355
106.[Pharaoh] said, "If you have come with a sign, then bring it 
forth, if you should be of the truthful."
107.So he [i.e., Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent,
manifest.356
108.And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white [with radiance]
for the observers.
109.Said the eminent among the people of Pharaoh, "Indeed, this 
is a learned magician
110.Who wants to expel you from your land [through magic], so 
what do you instruct?"
111.They said,357"Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother 
and send among the cities gatherers
                                               
352i.e., they persistently denied every warning given them.353i.e., they were found to be unfaithful and negligent of All Œh's covenant.354i.e., they rejected and opposed the signs.355i.e., free them from oppression and allow them to emigrate.356i.e., genuine and not imagined, as a miracle from All Œh.357After mutual consultation and agreement.

Page 170:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
148112.Who will bring you every learned magician."
113.And the magicians came to Pharaoh.  They said, "Indeed for 
us is a reward if we are the predominant."
114.He said, "Yes, and, [moreover], you will be among those made
near [to me]."
115.They said, "O Moses, ei ther you throw [your staff], or we will 
be the ones to throw [first]."
116.He said, "Throw," and when they threw, they bewitched the 
eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and they 
presented a great [feat of] magic.358
117.And We inspired to Moses , "Throw your staff," and at once it 
devoured what they were falsifying.
118.So the truth was established, and abolished was what they 
were doing.
119.And they [i.e., Pharaoh and his people] were overcome right 
there and became debased.
120.And the magi cians fell down in prostration [to All Œh].
121.They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
122.The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
123.Said Pharaoh, "You believed in him359before I gave you 
permission.  Indeed, this is a conspiracy which you conspi red 
in the city to expel therefrom its people.  But you are going to 
know.
124.I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides;
then I will surely crucify you all."
125.They said, "Indeed, to our Lord we will return.
126.And you do not resent us except because we believed in the
signs of our Lord when they came to us.  Our Lord, pour upon
us patience360and let us die as Muslims [in submission to You]."
                                               
358Their staffs and ropes appeared as writhing snakes.359i.e., in Moses, avoiding the mention of All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ).360To endure the torture to which we will be subjected.

Page 171:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
149127.And the eminent among the people of Pharaoh said, "Will you 
leave Moses and his pe ople to cause corruption in the land and 
abandon you and your gods?"  [Pharaoh] said, "We will kill 
their sons and keep their women alive; and indeed, we are 
subjugators over them."
128.Said Moses to his people, "Seek help through AllŒh and be 
patient.  I ndeed, the earth belongs to All Œh.  He causes to inherit
it whom He wills of His servants.  And the [best] outcome is 
for the righteous."
129.They said, "We have been harmed before you came to us and 
after you have come to us."  He said, "Perhaps your Lor d will 
destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and 
see how you will do."
130.And We certainly seized361the people of Pharaoh with years 
of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be 
reminded.
131.But when good [i.e., prov ision] came to them, they said, "This 
is ours [by right]."  And if a bad [condition] struck them, they
saw an evil omen in Moses and those with him.  Unquestionably,
their fortune is with All Œh, but most of them do not know.
132.And they said, "No matter what sign you bring us with which 
to bewitch us, we will not be believers in you."
133.So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs 
and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a 
criminal people.
134.And when the punishme nt descended upon them, they said, 
"O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised 
you.  If you [can] remove the punishment from us, we will surely
believe you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel."
135.But when We removed the punis hment from them until a term
which they were to reach,362then at once they broke their word.
                                               
361Imposed on them by way of trial and warning.362i.e., a specified term which would end with their reversion to disobedience
and disbelief.

Page 172:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
150136.So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the
sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.
137.And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit 
the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We 
had blessed.  And the good word [i.e., decree] of your Lord
was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they 
had patiently endured.  And We destroyed [al l] that Pharaoh and
his people were producing and what they had been building.
138.And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they 
came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs.   
They [the Children of Israel] said, "O Moses, make for us a god
just as they have gods."  He said, "Indeed, you are a people 
behaving ignorantly.
139.Indeed, those [worshippers] –destroyed is that in which they 
are [engaged], and worthless is whatever they were doing."
140.He said, "Is it other than AllŒh I should desire for you as a 
god363while He has preferred you over the worlds?"
141.And [recall, O Children of Israel], when We saved you from
the people of Pharaoh, [who were] afflicting you with the worst 
torment –killing your sons and keeping your women alive.   
And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
142.And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights 
and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his 
Lord was completed as forty nights.  And Moses said to his 
brother Aaron, "Take my place among my people, do right 
[by them],364and do not follow the way of the corrupters."
143.And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord 
spoke to him, he said, "My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I 
may look at You."  [All Œh]said, "You will not see Me,365but 
look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you 
                                               
363An object of worship.364i.e., keep their affairs in order.365During the life of this world.

Page 173:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
151will see Me."  But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, 
He rendered it level,366and Moses fell unconscious.  And 
when he awoke, he said, "Exalted are You!  I h ave repented to 
You, and I am the first of the believers."
144.[AllŒh] said, "O Moses, I have chosen you over the people 
with My messages and My words [to you].  So take what I 
have given you and be among the grateful."
145.And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all 
things –instruction and explanation for all things, [saying], 
"Take them with determination and order your people to take 
the best of it.  I will show you the home of the defiantly 
disobedient."367
146.I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon 
the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, 
they will not believe in it.  And if they see the way of 
consciousness,368they will not adopt it as a way; but if they 
see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way.  That is because
they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.
147.Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter –
their deeds have become worthless.  Are they recompensed 
except for what they used to do?
148.And the peopl e of Moses made, after [his departure], from 
their ornaments a calf –an image having a lowing sound.  
Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide 
them to a way?  They took it [for worship], and they were 
wrongdoers.
149.And when regre t overcame them369and they saw that they had 
gone astray, they said, "If our Lord does not have mercy upon 
us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers."
                                               
366It crumbled to dust.367This is a severe warning from All Œh against rebellion.368i.e., reason and integrity.369Literally, "When their hands had been descended upon," i.e., bitten by 
them out of severe regret.

Page 174:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
152150.And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, 
he said, "How wretched is that by which you have replaced 
me after [my departure].  Were you impatient over the matter 
of your Lord?"  And he threw down the tablets and seized his 
brother by [the hair of] his head, pulling him toward him.  
[Aaron] said, "O son of my mother, indeed the p eople oppressed
me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice 
over me370and do not place me among the wrongdoing people."
151.[Moses] said, "My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit 
us into Your mercy, for You are the most merciful of the 
merciful."
152.Indeed, those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger 
from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world, and 
thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood].
153.But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them 
and believed –indeed your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
154.And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took up the tablets;
and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who 
are fearful of their Lord.
155.And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our 
appointment.371  And when the earthquake seized them,372he 
said, "My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed 
them before and me [as well].  Would You destroy us for what 
the foolish among us have done?  This is n ot but Your trial by 
which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You 
will.  You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy 
upon us; and You are the best of forgivers.
156.And decree for us in this world [that which is] good and 
[also] in the Hereafter; indeed, we have turned back to You."  
                                               
370i.e., over your humiliation of me.371Whereupon they were to apologize to All Œh for having worshipped the calf.372Upon reaching the appointed place, they said to Moses, "We will not believe
until we see All Œh outright."  So the mountain convulsed, killing them.

Page 175:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
153[AllŒh] said, "My punishment –I afflict with it whom I will, 
but My mercy encompasses all things."  So I will decree it 
[especially] for those who fear Me and give zakŒh and those 
who believe in Our verses –
157.Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, 
whom they find written [i.e., mentioned] in what they have of 
the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is 
right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for 
them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and 
relieves them of their burden373and the shackles which were 
upon them.374  So they who have believed in him, honored 
him, supported him and followed the light which was sent 
down with him –it is those who will be the s uccessful.
158.Say, [O Muúammad ], "O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger
of All Œh to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion
of the heavens and the earth.  There is no deity except Him; 
He gives life and causes death."  So believe in AllŒh and His
Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in AllŒh and 
His words, and follow him that you may be guided.
159.And among the people of Moses is a community375which 
guides by truth and by it establishes justice.
160.And We divided them into twelve descendant tribes376[as 
distinct] nations.  And We inspired to Moses when his people 
implored him for water, "Strike with your staff the stone," 
and there gushed forth from it twelve springs.  Every people 
[i.e., tribe] knew its watering place.  And We shaded them 
with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, 
[saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have 
provided you."  And they wronged Us not, but they were 
[only] wronging themselves.
                                               
373Difficulties in religious practic e.374i.e., extreme measures previously required for repentance, and retribution 
without recourse to compensation.375Those of them who accepted and followed the final prophet, Muúammad ().376From the twelve sons of Jacob.

Page 176:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
154161.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when it was said to them, 
"Dwell in this city [i.e., Jerusalem] and eat from it wherever 
you will and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens [i.e., sins],' and 
enter the gate bowing humbly; We will [then] forgive you 
your sins.  We will increase the doers of good [in goodness 
and reward]. "
162.But those who wronged among them changed [the words] to a 
statement other than that which had been said to them.  So We 
sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that 
they were doing.
163.And ask them about the town that was by the sea –when they 
transgressed in [the matter of] the sabbath –when their fish 
came to them openly on their sabbath day, and the day they 
had no sabbath they did not come to them.  Thus did We give 
them trial because they were defiantly disobedient.
164.And w hen a community among them said, "Why do you advise
[or warn] a people whom AllŒh is [about] to destroy or to 
punish with a severe punishment?" they [the advisors] said, 
"To be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear 
Him."
165.And when they [i .e., those advised] forgot that by which they 
had been reminded, We saved those who had forbidden evil 
and seized those who wronged, with a wretched punishment, 
because they were defiantly disobeying.
166.So when they were insolent about that which they had been 
forbidden, We said to them, "Be apes, despised."
167.And [mention] when your Lord declared that He would surely
[continue to] send upon them until the Day of Resurrection 
those who would afflict them with the worst torment.  Indeed,
your Lord is s wift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
168.And We divided them throughout the earth into nations.  Of
them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise.   
And We tested them with good [times] and bad that perhaps 
they would retu rn [to obedience].

Page 177:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
155169.And there followed them successors who inherited the 
Scripture [while] taking the commodities377of this lower life 
and saying, "It will be forgiven for us."  And if an offer like 
it378comes to them, they will [again] take it.  Was notthe 
covenant of the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] taken from them 
that they would not say about All Œh except the truth, and they 
studied what was in it?  And the home of the Hereafter is 
better for those who fear All Œh, so will you not use reason?
170.But those who hold fast to the Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] and 
establish prayer –indeed, We will not allow to be lost the 
reward of the reformers.
171.And [mention] when We raised the mountain above them as 
if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall 
upon them,379[and AllŒh said], "Take what We have given 
you with determination and remember what is in it that you 
might fear All Œh."
172.And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of 
Adam –from their loins –their descendants and made them 
testify of themselves, [saying to them], "Am I not your Lord?"   
They said, "Yes, we have testified." [This] –lest you should say
on the Day of Resurrection, "Indeed, we were of this unaware."
173.Or [lest] you say, "It was only that our fathers associated 
[others in worship] with AllŒh before, and we were but 
descendants after them.  Then would You destroy us for what 
the falsifiers have done?"
174.And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps 
they will return.380
175.And recite to them , [O Muúammad ], the news of him381to 
                                               
377i.e., unlawful gains and pleasures.378i.e., a similar temptation.379For their rebellion and disobedience.380To the way of AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ), from their diversions and 
deviations.381A man from the Children of Israe l at the time of Moses.

Page 178:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
156whom We gave [knowledge of] Our signs, but he detached 
himself from them; so Satan pursued him, and he became of 
the deviators.382
176.And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby ,383
but he adhered [instead] tothe earth384and followed his own 
desire.  So his example is like that of the dog:  if you chase 
him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants.  That is the 
example of the people who denied Our signs.385  So relate the 
stories that perhaps they will gi ve thought.
177.How evil an example [is that of] the people who denied Our 
signs and used to wrong themselves.
178.Whoever AllŒh guides –he is the [rightly] guided; and 
whoever He sends astray386–it is those who are the losers.
179.And We have certainl y created for Hell many of the jinn and 
mankind.  They have hearts with which they do not understand,
they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears
with which they do not hear.  Those are like livestock; rather, 
they are more astray.387  It is they who are the heedless.
180.And to All Œh belong the best names, so invoke Him by them.  
And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation 
concerning His names.388  They will be recompensed for what 
they have been doing.
181.And among those We cr eated is a community389which guides 
by truth and thereby establishes justice.
                                               
382Those who deliberately persist in error to the point of destruction.383i.e., through the revelations, signs or evidences of which he had been 
given knowledge.384i.e., its worldly pleasures.385Whether or not they have been exposed to A llŒh's signs or warnings, it is 
all the same:  they will not believe.386As a result of persistence in evil and rejection of truth.387The reference is to their inability (i.e., refusal) to think and reason, while 
blindly following (as they are accustomed).388i.e., use them improperly or deny them.389The followers of Prophet Muúammad ().

Page 179:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
157182.But those who deny Our signs –We will progressively lead 
them [to destruction]390from where they do not know.
183.And I will give them time.  Indeed, My plan is firm.
184.Then do they not give thought?  There is in their companion 
[i.e., Muúammad ()] no madness.  He is not but a clear warner.
185.Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth 
and everything that All Œh has created and [think] that perhaps 
their appointed time has come near?  So in what statement 
[i.e., message] hereafter will they believe?
186.Whoever All Œh sends astray –there is no guide for him.  And 
He leaves them in their transgression, wandering blindly.
187.They ask you, [O Muúammad ], about the Hour:  when is its 
arrival?391  Say, "Its knowledge is only with my Lord.  None 
will reveal its time except Him.  It lays heavily392upon the 
heavens and the earth.  It will not come upon you except 
unexpectedly."  They ask you as if you are familiar with it.  
Say, "Its knowledge is only with All Œh, but most of the people
do not know."
188.Say, "I hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, 
except what AllŒh has willed.  And if I knew the unseen, I 
could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have 
touched me.  I am not except a warner and a bringer of good 
tidings to a people who believe."
189.It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its 
mate that he393might dwell in security with her.  And when 
he [i.e., man] covers her,394she carries a light burden [i.e., a 
pregnancy] and continues therein.  And when it becomes heavy,
                                               
390AllŒh will test them with one favor after another in spite of their disobedience,
which only increases them in arrogance and sin.391Literally, "resting" or "establishment."392i.e., it is a source of concern, worry or fear.393i.e., man or every descendent of Adam.394An allusion to sexual intercourse.

Page 180:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
158they both invoke AllŒh, their Lord, "If You should give us a 
good395[child], we will surely be among the grateful."
190.But when He gives them a good [child], they396ascribe 
partners to Him concerning that which He has given them.  
Exalted is All Œh above what they associate with Him.
191.Do they associate with Him those who create nothing and they 
are [themselves] created?
192.And they [i.e., the false de ities] are unable to [give] them help, 
nor can they help themselves.
193.And if you [believers] invite them to guidance, they will not 
follow you.  It is all the same for you whether you invite them
or you are silent.
194.Indeed, those you [polytheists] call upon besides AllŒh are 
servants [i.e., creations] like you.  So call upon them and let 
them respond to you, if you should be truthful.
195.Do they have feet by which they walk?  Or do they have 
hands by which they strike?  Or do they have eyes by which 
they see?  Or do they have ears by which they hear?  Say, [O 
Muúammad ], "Call your 'partners' and then conspire against 
me and give me no respite.
196.Indeed, my protector is All Œh, who has sent down the Book; 
and He is an ally to the righteous.
197.And those you call upon besides Him are unable to help you, 
nor can they help themselves."
198.And if you invite them to guidance, they do not hear; and you 
see them looking at you while they do not see.
199.Take what is given freely,397enjoin what is good , and turn 
away from the ignorant.
                                               
395Physically sound or righteous.396The ungrateful man and woman or the polytheistic man and woman.397From the dispositions of men or from their wealth.  In other words, be 
easy in dealing with them and avoid causing them difficulty.

Page 181:
S´rah 7–al-AÔrŒf JuzÕ 9
159200.And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek 
refuge in All Œh.  Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing.
201.Indeed, those who fear All Œh –when an impulse touches them
from Satan, they remember [Him] and a t once they have insight.
202.But their brothers398–they [i.e., the devils] increase them in 
error; then they do not stop short.
203.And when you, [O Muúammad ], do not bring them a sign 
[i.e., miracle], they say, "Why have you not contrived it?"  
Say, "Ionly follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.  
This [QurÕ Œn] is enlightenment from your Lord and guidance 
and mercy for a people who believe."
204.So when the QurÕŒn is recited, then listen to it and pay 
attention that you may receive mercy.
205.And remember your Lord within yourself in humility and in 
fear without being apparent in speech –in the mornings and 
the evenings.  And do not be among the heedless.
206.Indeed, those who are near your Lord [i.e., the angels] are not 
prevented by arrogance f rom His worship, and they exalt Him, 
and to Him they prostrate.
                                               
398Those among mankind who listen to the devils and obey their orders.

1.They ask you, [O Muúammad ], about the bounties [of war].  
Say, "The [decision concerning] bounties is for AllŒh and the 
Messenger."  So fear All Œh and amend that which is between you 
and obey All Œh and His Messenger, if you should be believers.
2.The believers are only those who, when AllŒh is me ntioned, 
their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to 
them, it increases them in fa ith; and upon their Lord they rely –
3.The ones who establish prayer, and from what We have 
provided them, they spend.
4.Those are the believers, truly.  For them are degrees [of high 
position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision.
5.[It400is] just as when your Lord brought you out of your home 
[for the battle of Badr] in truth, while indeed, a party among the 
believers were unwilling,
6.Arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear, 
as if they were being driven toward death while they were 
looking on.
7.[Remember, O believers], when All Œh promised you one of the 
two groups401–that it would be yours –and you wished that the 
unarmed one would be yours.  But AllŒh intended to establish 
the truth by His words and to elimina te the disbelievers
8.That He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if 
the criminals disliked it.
9.[Remember] when you asked help of your Lord, and He 
answered you, "Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand 
from the angels, followin g one another."
                                               
399Al-AnfŒl :  The Bounties, meaning those things acquired in addition to victory, 
i.e., the sp oils of war.400Referring to a dispute which occurred among the Muslims over distribution
of war booty.401i.e., either the caravan of Quraysh or their army.

Page 183:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 9
16110.And All Œh made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts 
would be assured thereby.  And victory is not but from All Œh.  
Indeed, All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
11.[Remember] when He overwhelmed you with drowsiness 
[giving] se curity from Him and sent down upon you from the 
sky, rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil 
[suggestions] of Satan and to make steadfast your hearts and 
plant firmly thereby your feet.
12.[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, "I am 
with you, so strengthen those who have believed.  I will cast 
terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them]
upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip."402
13.That is because they opposed All Œh and His Messenger.  And 
whoever opposes All Œh and His Messenger –indeed, All Œh is 
severe in penalty.
14."That [is yours], so taste it."  And indeed for the disbelievers 
is the punishment of the Fire.
15.O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve
advancing [ inbattle], do not turn to them your backs [in flight].
16.And whoever turns his back to them on such a day, unless 
swerving [as a strategy] for war or joining [another] company, 
has certainly returned with anger [upon him] from AllŒh, and 
his refuge is Hell –and wretched is the destination.
17.And you did not kill them, but it was All Œh who killed them .403  
And you threw not, [O Muúammad ], when you threw, but it 
was All Œh who threw404that He might test the believers with a 
good test.405  Indeed, All Œh is Hearing a nd Knowing.
                                               
402By which they grasp and manipulate their weapons.  Also interpreted as 
"all extremities," i.e., their hands and feet.403i.e., Your strength was insufficient to overcome them, but AllŒh supported
you and gave you victory.404When the Prophet () threw a handful of dust into the faces of the 
disbelievers, AllŒh caused it to fill the eyes and nose of every soldier, 
preventing their advance.405So that they would appreciate All Œh's favor to them.

Page 184:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 9
16218.That [is so], and [also] that AllŒh will weaken the plot of the 
disbelievers.
19.If you [disbelievers] seek the decision [i.e., victory] –the 
decision [i.e., defeat] has come to you.  And if you desist 
[from hostilities], it is best for y ou; but if you return [to war], 
We will return, and never will you be availed by your [large] 
company at all, even if it should increase; and [that is] because 
AllŒh is with the believers.
20.O you who have believed, obey All Œh and His Messenger and 
do no t turn from him while you hear [his order].
21.And do not be like those who say, "We have heard," while 
they do not hear.
22.Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of AllŒh are 
the deaf and dumb who do not use reason [i.e., the disbelievers].
23.Had AllŒh known any good in them, He would have made 
them hear.  And if He had made them hear, they would [still] 
have turned away, while they were refusing.
24.O you who have believed, respond to AllŒh and to the 
Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life.  
And know that AllŒh intervenes between a man and his heart 
and that to Him you will be gathered.
25.And fear a trial406which will not strike those who have 
wronged among you exclusively, and know that AllŒh is 
severe in penalty.
26.And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, 
fearing that people might abduct you, but He sheltered you, 
supported you with His victory, and provided you with good 
things –that you might be grateful.
27.O you who have believed, do not betray AllŒh and the Messenger
or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence].
                                               
406i.e., an affliction or punishment during life upon this earth.  When 
corruption spreads among a people, its consequences will affect everyone.

Page 185:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 9
16328.And know that your properties and your children are but a 
trial and that All Œh has with Him a great reward.
29.O you who have believed, if you fear All Œh, He will grant y ou 
a criterion407and will remove from you your misdeeds and 
forgive you.  And All Œh is the possessor of great bounty.
30.And [remember, O Muúammad ], when those who disbelieved 
plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you 
[from Makkah].  But they plan, and All Œh plans.  And All Œh is 
the best of planners.
31.And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, "We have 
heard.  If we willed, we could say [something] like this.  This 
is not but legends of the former peoples."
32.And [remember] when they said, "O AllŒh, if this should be 
the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the 
sky or bring us a painful punishment."
33.But All Œh would not punish them while you, [O Muúammad ], 
are among them, and All Œh would not punish them while they 
seek forgiveness.
34.But why should AllŒh not punish them while they obstruct 
[people] from al -Masjid al -îarŒm and they were not [fit to be] 
its guardians?  Its [true] guardians are not but the righteous, 
but most of them do not know.
35.And their p rayer at the House [i.e., the KaÔbah ] was not except 
whistling and handclapping.  So taste the punishment for what 
you disbelieved [i.e., practiced of deviations].
36.Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert 
[people] from the way of All Œh.  So they will spend it; then it 
will be for them a [source of] regret; then they will be 
overcome.  And those who have disbelieved –unto Hell they 
will be gathered.
                                               
407By which to judge between truth and falsehood.  Also interpreted as a 
"way out" of difficulties.

Page 186:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
16437.[It is] so that All Œh may distinguish the wicked from the good 
and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap 
them all together and put them into Hell.  It is those who are 
the losers.
38.Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what 
has previously occurred will be forgiven for them.  But if they 
return [to hostili ty] –then the precedent of the former 
[rebellious] peoples has already taken place.408
39.And fight them until there is no fitnah409and [until] the 
religion [i.e., worship], all of it, is for AllŒh.410  And if they 
cease –then indeed, All Œh is Seeing of what they do.
40.But if they turn away –then know that All Œh is your protector.  
Excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.
41.And know that anything you obtain of war booty –then 
indeed, for All Œh is one fifth of it and for the Messenger411and 
for [his] near relatives412and the orphans, the needy, and the 
[stranded] traveler,413if you have believed in All Œh and in that 
which We sent down to Our Servant414on the day of criterion 
[i.e., decisive encounter] –the day when the two armies met 
[at Badr ].  And All Œh, over all things, is competent.
42.[Remember] when you were on the near side of the valley, 
and they were on the farther side, and the caravan was lower 
[in position] than you.  If you had made an appointment [to meet], 
you would have missed the appointment.  But [it was] so that 
AllŒh might accomplish a matter already destined –that those 
who perished [through disbelief] would perish upon evidence 
                                               
408This is a warning that punishment is always the result of rebellio n against 
AllŒh and His messengers.409Persecution .  See footnote to 2:193 .410i.e., until polytheism is no longer dominant.411To be spent in All Œh's cause.412The tribes of Ban´ HŒshim and Ban´ Mu‹‹alib, who were not eligible for 
zakŒh.413The remaining four fifth s are divided among the soldiers.414Prophet Muúammad ( ).

Page 187:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
165and those who lived [in faith] would live upon evidence; and 
indeed, All Œh is Hearing and Know ing.
43.[Remember, O Muúammad ], when All Œh showed them to you 
in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many,
you [believers] would have lost courage and would have 
disputed in the matter [of whether to fight], but AllŒh saved 
[you from tha t].  Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
44.And [remember] when He showed them to you, when you met,
as few in your eyes, and He made you [appear] as few in their 
eyes so that All Œh might accomplish a matter already destined.  
And to All Œh are [all] matters returned.
45.O you who have believed, when you encounter a company 
[from the enemy forces], stand firm and remember All Œh much
that you may be successful.
46.And obey AllŒh and His Messenger, and do not dispute and 
[thus] lose courage an d [then] your strength would depart; and 
be patient.  Indeed, All Œh is with the patient.
47.And do not be like those who came forth from their homes 
insolently and to be seen by people and avert [them] from the 
way of All Œh.  And All Œh is encompassing415ofwhat they do.
48.And [remember] when Satan made their deeds pleasing to 
them and said, "No one can overcome you today from among 
the people, and indeed, I am your protector."  But when the 
two armies sighted each other, he turned on his heels and said, 
"Indeed, I am disassociated from you.  Indeed, I see what you 
do not see; indeed, I fear All Œh.  And All Œh is severe in penalty."
49.[Remember] when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was
disease [i.e., arrogance and disbelief] said, "Their religion has 
deluded those [Muslims]."  But whoever relies upon AllŒh –
then indeed, All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
50.And if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those
                                               
415In knowledge .  See footnote to 2:19.

Page 188:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
166who disbelieved...416  They are striking their faces and their 
backs and [say ing], "Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.
51.That is for what your hands have put forth [of evil] and because
AllŒh is not ever unjust to His servants."
52.[Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and of 
those before them.  They disbel ieved in the signs of All Œh, so 
AllŒh seized them for their sins.  Indeed, AllŒh is Powerful 
and severe in penalty.
53.That is because All Œh would not change a favor which He had 
bestowed upon a people until they change what is w ithin 
themselves.  And ind eed, All Œh is Hearing and Knowing.
54.[Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and of 
those before them.  They denied the signs of their Lord, so We 
destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the people of 
Pharaoh.  And all [of them] were w rongdoers.
55.Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of AllŒh are 
those who have disbelieved, and they will not [ever] believe –
56.The ones with whom you made a treaty but then they break 
their pledge every time, and they do not fear All Œh.
57.So if you, [O Muúammad ], gain dominance over them in war, 
disperse by [means of] them those behind them that perhaps 
they will be reminded.417
58.If you [have reason to] fear from a people betrayal, throw 
[their treaty] back to them, [putting you] on equal terms.418  
Indeed, All Œh does not like traitors.
                                               
416This sentence is left incomplete for additional effect.  Its conclusion is 
left to the imagination of the reader or listener and estimated as "...you 
would see a dreadful sight."417i.e., kill them and make an example of them to discourage those who 
follow them.418When you see signs of treachery from those with whom you have made a 
treaty, announce to them its dissolution so they will know exactly where 
they stand.

S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
16759.And let not those who disbelieve think they will escape.  Indeed,
they will not cause failure [to All Œh].
60.And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and 
of steeds of war419by which you may terrify the enemy of All Œh
and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not 
know [but] whom AllŒh knows.  And whatever you spend in 
the cause of All Œh will be fully repaid to you, and you will not 
be wronged.
61.And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely
upon All Œh.  Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.
62.But if they intend to deceive you –then sufficient for you is All Œh.  
It is He who supported you with His help and with the believers
63.And brought togeth er their hearts.  If you had spent all that is 
in the earth, you could not have brought their hearts together; 
but AllŒh brought them together.  Indeed, He is Exalted in 
Might and Wise.
64.O Prophet, sufficient for you is All Œh and for whoever follows 
youof the believers.
65.O Prophet, urge the believers to battle.  If there are among you 
twenty [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred.  
And if there are among you one hundred [who are] steadfast, 
they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved 
because they are a people who do not understand.
66.Now, All Œh has lightened [the hardship] for you, and He knows 
that among you is weakness.  So if there are from you one 
hundred [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred.  
And if there are among you a thousand, they will overcome 
two thousand by permission of AllŒh.  And AllŒh is with the 
steadfast.
67.It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts 
a massacre [upon AllŒh's enemies] in the land.  You [i.e., 
some Muslims] desire the commodities of this world,420but 
                                               
419Or equipment which serves the same purpose.420i.e., material benefit, such as the ransom paid for prisoners.

Page 190:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
168AllŒh desires [for you] the Hereafter.  And All Œh is Exalted in 
Might and Wise.
68.If not for a decree from AllŒh that preceded,421you would 
have been touched for what you took by a great punishment.
69.So consume what you have taken of war booty [as being] 
lawful and good, and fear AllŒh.  Indeed, AllŒh is Forgiving 
and Merciful.
70.O Prophet, say to whoever is in your hands of the captives, "If 
AllŒh knows [any] good in your hearts, He will give you 
[something] better than what was taken from you, and He will 
forgive you; and All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful."
71.But if they intend to betray you –then they have already 
betrayed AllŒh before, and He empowered [you] over them.  
And All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
72.Indeed, those who have believed and emigrated and fought 
with their wealth and lives in the cause of AllŒh and those 
who gave shelter and aided –they are allies of one another.  
But those who believed and did not emigrate –for you there is 
no support of them until they emigrate.  And if they seek help 
of you for the religion, then you must help, except against a 
people between yourselves and whom is a treaty.  And AllŒh 
is Seeing of what you do.
73.And those who disbelieved are allies of one another.  If you 
do not do so [i.e., ally yourselves with other believers], there 
will be fitnah [i.e., disbelief and oppression] on earth and 
great corruption.
74.But those who have believed and emigrated and fought in the 
cause of AllŒh and those who gave shelter and aided –it is 
they who are the believers, truly.  For them is forgiveness and 
noble provision.
                                               
421Three interpretations of the "decree" are given:  that by which the 
companions of Badr were forgiven, that by which indeliberate errors in 
judgeme nt by believers are not punished, and that which made lawful the 
spoils of war.

Page 191:
S´rah 8–al-AnfŒl JuzÕ 10
16975.And those who believed after [the initial emigration] and 
emigrated and fought with you –they are of you.  But those of 
[blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the 
decree of All Œh.422  Indeed, All Œh is Knowing of all things.
                                               
422This applies to Muslim relatives only.  Others may be given by bequest.

1.[This is a declaration of] disassociation, from AllŒh and His 
Messenger, to those with whom you had made a treaty among 
the polytheists.424
2.So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land [during] 
four months but know that you cannot cause failure to AllŒh 
and that All Œh will disgrace the disbelievers.
3.And [it is] an announcement from AllŒh and His Messenger to 
the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage425that AllŒh is 
disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger.  
So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away –then 
know that you will not cause failure to AllŒh.426  And give 
tidings to those w ho disbelieve of a painful punishment.
4.Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the 
polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in 
anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them 
their treaty until their term [has ended].  Indeed, All Œh loves the 
righteous [who fear Him].
5.And when the sacred months427have passed, then kill t he
polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege
them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush.  But if 
they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakŒh, let them 
[go] on their way.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
6.And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then 
grant him protection so that he may hear the words of AllŒh 
                                               
423At-Tawbah :  Repentance.  This s´rah is also known as BarŒÕah, meaning 
disassociation, freed om, release or immunity.  The words BismillŒhir -
RaúmŒnir -Raúeem were not revealed at the beginning of this s´rah.424But who had violated it.425îajj.   ÔUmrah is the lesser pilgrimage.426i.e., you cannot escape His punishment.427The four months mentioned in vers e 2, i.e., Muúarram , Rajab , Dhul -QaÔdah
and Dhul -îijjah.

S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
171[i.e., the QurÕŒn].  Then deliver him to his place of safety.  
That is because they are a people who do not know.
7.How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of 
AllŒh and with His Messenger, except for those with whom 
you made a treaty at al -Masj id al-îarŒm?  So as long as they 
are upright toward you,428be upright toward them.  Indeed, 
AllŒh loves the righteous [who fear Him].
8.How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over
you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship 
or covenant of protection?  They satisfy you with their mouths,
but their hearts refuse [compliance], and most of them are 
defiantly disobedient.
9.They have exchanged the signs of All Œh for a small price and 
averted [people] from His way.  Indeed, it was evil that they 
were doing.
10.They do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or 
covenant of protection.  And it is they who are the transgressors.
11.But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakŒh, then they 
are your brothers in religion; and We detail the verses for a 
people who know.
12.And if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame 
your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief, for indeed, 
there are no oaths [sacred] to them; [fight them that] they 
might cease.
13.Would you not fight a people who broke their oaths and 
determined to expel the Messenger, and they had begun [the 
attack upon] you the first time?  Do you fear them?  But All Œh 
has more right that you should fear Him, if you are [truly] 
believers.
14.Fight them; AllŒh will punish them by your hands and will 
disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the 
breasts [i.e., desires] of a believing people
                                               
428i.e., maintain the terms of the treaty.

Page 194:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
17215.And remove the fury in their [i.e., the believers'] hearts.  And 
AllŒh turns in forgiv eness to whom He wills; and AllŒh is 
Knowing and Wise.
16.Do you think that you will be left [as you are] while All Œh has not 
yet made evident those among you who strive [for His cause] and
do not take other than All Œh, His Messenger and the believers 
as intimates?  And All Œh is Acquainted with what you do.
17.It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of AllŒh
[while] witnessing against themselves with disbelief.  [For] those,
their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire they will 
abide eternally.
18.The mosques of All Œh are only to be maintained by those who 
believe in AllŒh and the Last Day and establish prayer and 
give zakŒh and do not fear except All Œh, for it is expected that 
those will be of the [rightly] guided.
19.Have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the 
maintenance of al-Masjid al-îarŒm equal to [the deeds of] 
one who believes in All Œh and the Last Day and strives in the 
cause of All Œh?  They are not equal in the sight of All Œh.  And 
AllŒh does not guide the wrongdoing people.
20.The ones who have believed, emigrated and striven in the cause
of All Œh with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in 
the sight of AllŒh.  And it is those who are the attainers [of 
success].
21.Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and 
approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure.
22.[They will be] abiding therein forever.  Indeed, All Œh has with 
Him a great reward.
23.O you who have believed, do not take your fathers or your 
brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief.  
And whoever does so among you –then it is those who are the 
wrongdoers.
24.Say, [O Muúammad ], "If your fathers, your sons, your brothers,
your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, 

Page 195:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
173commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which
you are pleased are more beloved to you than AllŒh and His 
Messenger and jihŒd [i.e., striving] in His cause, then wait 
until All Œh executes His command.  And All Œh does not guide 
the defiantly disob edient people."
25.AllŒh has already given you victory in many regions and [even] 
on the day of îunayn, when your great number pleased you, 
butit did not avail you at all, and the earth was confining for 
you with [i.e., in spite of] its vastness; then you turned back, 
fleeing.
26.Then All Œh sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and 
upon the believers and sent down soldiers [i.e., angels] whom 
you did not see and punished those who disbelieved.  And that 
is the recompense of the disbelievers.
27.Then AllŒh will accept repentance after that for whom He 
wills; and All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
28.O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, 
so let them not approach al-Masjid al-îarŒm after this, their 
[final] year.  And if you fear privation, AllŒh will enrich you 
from His bounty if He wills.  Indeed, All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
29.Fight those who do not believe in All Œh or in the Last Day and 
who do not consider unlawful what All Œh and His Messenger 
have made unlawful and who do n ot adopt the religion of truth 
[i.e., Isl Œm] from those who were given the Scripture –[fight] 
until they give the jizyah429willingly while they are humbled.
30.The Jews say, "Ezra is the son of AllŒh"; and the Christians 
say, "T he Messiah is the son of Al lŒh."  That is their statement 
from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who 
disbelieved before [them].  May AllŒh destroy them; how are 
they deluded?
                                               
429A tax required of non -Muslims exempting them from military service and 
entitling them to the protection of the Isl Œmic state.  Concurrently, zakŒh 
is not tak en from them, being an obligation only upon Muslims.

17431.They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides 
AllŒh,430and [also] the Messiah, t he son of Mary.431  And they 
were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no 
deity except Him.  Exalted is He above whatever they associate
with Him.
32.They want to extinguish the light of AllŒh with their mouths, 
but AllŒh refuses except to perfect His light, although the 
disbelievers dislike it.
33.It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the 
religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although they 
who associate others with All Œh dislike it.
34.O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and 
the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly432and avert 
[them] from the way of All Œh.  And those who hoard gold and 
silver and spen d it not in the way of All Œh –give them tidings 
of a painful punishment.
35.The Day when it433will be heated in the fire of Hell and seared 
therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs,
[it will be said], "This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so 
taste what you used to hoard."
36.Indeed, the number of months with All Œh is twelve [lunar] months 
in the register of All Œh [from] the day He created the heavens 
and the earth; of these, four are sacred.434  That is the correct 
religion [i.e., way], so do not wrong yourselves during them .435  
And fight against the disbelievers collecti vely as they fight against 
you collectively.  And know that AllŒh is with the righteous 
[who fear Him].
37.Indeed, the postponing [of restriction within sacred months] is 
an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved 
                                               
430By their obedience to them rather than to what All Œh ordained.431By their worship of him in conjunction with All Œh.432i.e., through false pretense.433The gold and silver which was hoarded, i.e., whose zakŒhwas not paid.434See footnote to 9:5.435i.e., do not violate the sacred months or commit aggression therein.

Page 197:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
175are led [further] astra y.  They make it436lawful one year and 
unlawful another year to correspond to the number made 
unlawful by AllŒh437and [thus] make lawful what AllŒh has 
made unlawful.  Made pleasing to them is the evil of their 
deeds; and All Œh does not guide the disbelievin g people.
38.O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, 
when you are told to go forth in the cause of AllŒh, you 
adhere heavily to the earth?438  Are you satisfied with the life 
of this world rather than the Hereafter?  But what is the 
enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a 
[very] little.
39.If you do not go forth, He will punish you with a painful 
punishment and will replace you with another people, and you 
will not harm Him at all.  And AllŒh is over all things 
comp etent.
40.If you do not aid him [i.e., the Prophet ()] –AllŒh has 
already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him 
out [of Makkah] as one of two,439when they were in the cave 
and he [i.e., Muúammad ()] said to his companion, "Do not 
grieve; indeed AllŒh is with us."  And AllŒh sent down His 
tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers [i.e., 
angels] you did not see and made the word440of those who 
disbelieved the lowest,441while the word of AllŒh442–that is 
the highest.  And All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
41.Go forth, whether light o r heavy,443and strive with your wealth 
                                               
436Fighting during a sacred month.437If they found it advantageous to violate a sacred month, they would do so, 
designating another month in its place in which to observe the restrictions 
concerning fighting.438i.e., inclining toward the comforts of worldly life.439The second was his companion, Ab´Bakr .440i.e., their claims and slogans.441i.e., degraded and dishonored.442"LŒ ilŒha ill -AllŒh" ("There is no de ity except All Œh").443i.e., young or old, riding or walking, in ease or in hardship –in all 
circumstances and conditions.

Page 198:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
176and your lives in the cause of All Œh.  That is better for you, if 
you only knew.
42.Had it been a near [i.e., easy] gain and a moderate trip, they 
[i.e., the hypocrites] would have followed you, but distant to 
them wa s the journey.  And they will swear by All Œh,444"If we 
were able, we would have gone forth with you," destroying 
themselves [through false oaths], and All Œh knows that indeed 
they are liars.
43.May AllŒh pardon you, [O Muúammad ]; why did you give 
them perm ission [to remain behind]?  [You should not have] 
until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew 
[who were] the liars.
44.Those who believe in AllŒh and the Last Day would not ask 
permission of you to be excused from striving [i.e., fighting] 
with their wealth and their lives.  And AllŒh is Knowing of 
those who fear Him.
45.Only those would ask permission of you who do not believe in 
AllŒh and the Last Day and whose hearts have doubted, and they,
in their doubt, are hesitating.
46.And if they had intended to go forth, they would have prepared
for it [some] preparation.  But All Œh disliked their being sent, 
so He kept them back, and they were told, "Remain [behind] 
with those who remain."445
47.Had they gone forth with you, they would not have i ncreased 
you except in confusion, and they would have been active among 
you, seeking [to cause] you fitnah [i.e., chaos and dissension].  
And among you are avid listeners to them.  And All Œh is Knowing
of the wrongdoers.
48.They had already desired dissen sion before and had upset matters
for you446until the truth came and the ordinance [i.e., victory] 
of All Œh appeared, while they were averse.
                                               
444When you return from the Tab´k expedition.445i.e., the women and children.446Or "turned matters related to you over [in their minds, co nsidering how to 
cause you failure]."

S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
17749.And among them is he who says, "Permit me [to remain at home]
and do not put me to trial."  Unquestionably, int o trial they have
fallen.447  And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers.
50.If good befalls you, it distresses them; but if disaster strikes you,
they say, "We took our matter [in hand] before,"448and turn 
away while they are rejoicing.
51.Say, "Neve r will we be struck except by what All Œh has decreed
for us; He is our protector."  And upon All Œh let the believers rely.
52.Say, "Do you await for us except one of the two best things 
[i.e., martyrdom or victory] while we await for you that All Œh 
will a fflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands?   
So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting."
53.Say, "Spend willingly or unwillingly; never will it be accepted 
from you.  Indeed, you have been a defiantly disobedient people."
54.And what p revents their expenditures from being accepted from 
them but that they have disbelieved in All Œh and in His Messenger
and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy 
and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling.
55.So let not the ir wealth or their children impress you.  All Œh only 
intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that
their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.
56.And they swear by All Œh that they are from among you while 
they are not from among you; but they are a people who are 
afraid.
57.If they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter 
[and hide], they would turn to it while they run heedlessly.
58.And among them are some who criticize you concerning the 
[distributio n of] charities.  If they are given from them, they 
approve; but if they are not given from them, at once they 
become angry.
                                               
447By avoiding their obligation, they fell into destruction.448The hypocrites claim to have protected themselves by remaining behind.

Page 200:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
17859.If only they had been satisfied with what AllŒh and His 
Messenger gave them and said, "Sufficient for us is AllŒh; 
AllŒh will g ive us of His bounty, and [so will] His Messenger; 
indeed, we are desirous toward All Œh,"449[it would have been 
better for them].
60.ZakŒh expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy 
and for those employed for it450and for bringing hearts 
together [for IslŒm] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and 
for those in debt and for the cause of AllŒh and for the 
[stranded] traveler –an obligation [imposed] by AllŒh.  And 
AllŒh is Knowing and Wise.
61.And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, 
"He is an ear."451  Say, "[It is] an ear of goodness for you that 
believes in All Œh and believes the believers and [is] a mercy to 
those who believe among you."  And those who abuse the 
Messenger of All Œh –for them is a painful punishment.
62.They swear by AllŒh to you [Muslims] to satisfy you.  But 
AllŒh and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, 
if they should be believers.
63.Do they not know that whoever opposes AllŒh and His 
Messenger –that for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will 
abide eternally?  That is the great disgrace.
64.The hypocrites are apprehensive lest a s´rah be revealed about 
them, informing them of452what is in their hearts.  Say, 
"Mock [as you wish]; indeed, AllŒh will expose that which 
you fear."
65.And if you ask them, they will surely say, "We were only 
conversing and playing."  Say, "Is it All Œh and His verses and 
His Messenger that you were mocking?"
                                               
449Meaning "We desire All Œh and His grace and acceptance," or "We desire 
whatever All Œh wills to give us of His bounty."450By the state to collect, guard and distribute the zakŒh.451i.e., one who believes everything he hears.452i.e., exposing the truth about.

Page 201:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
17966.Make no excuse; you have disbelieved [i.e., rejected faith] 
after your belief.  If We pardon one faction of y ou –We will 
punish another faction because they were criminals.
67.The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another.  
They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close 
their hands.453  They have forgotten All Œh, so He has forgotten 
them [accordingly].  Indeed, the hypocrites –it is they who 
are the defiantly disobedient.
68.AllŒh has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women 
and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide 
eternally.  It is sufficient for them.  And A llŒh has cursed them,
and for them is an enduring punishment.
69.[You disbelievers are ] like those before you; they were stronger
than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children.  
They enjoyed their portion [of worldly enjoyment], and you
have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their 
portion, and you have engaged [in vanities] like that in which 
they engaged.  [It is] those whose deeds have become worthless
in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the 
losers.
70.Has there not reached them the news of those before them –
the people of Noah and [the tribes of] ÔAad and Tham´d and 
the people of Abraham and the companions [i.e., dwellers] of 
Madyan and the towns overturned?454  Their messengers came 
to them with clear p roofs.  And All Œh would never have wronged
them, but they were wronging themselves.
71.The believing men and believing women are allies of one 
another.   They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong 
and establish prayer and give zakŒh and obey AllŒh and His 
Messenger.  Those –AllŒh will have mercy upon them.  
Indeed, All Œh is Exalted in Might and Wise.
                                               
453i.e., refuse to spend in the way of All Œh.454i.e., those to which Lot was sent and which earned for themselves All Œh's 
punishment .  See 11:82 -83.

Page 202:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
18072.AllŒh has promised the believing men and believing women
gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, 
and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but 
approval from AllŒh is greater.  It is that which is the great 
attainment.
73.O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites 
and be harsh upon them.  And their refuge is Hell, and wretched
is the destina tion.
74.They swear by AllŒh that they did not say [anything against 
the Prophet ()] while they had said the word of disbelief and 
disbelieved after their [pretense of] IslŒm and planned that 
which they were not to attain.455  And they were not resentful 
except [for the fact] that AllŒh and His Messenger had 
enriched them of His bounty.456  So if they repent, it is better 
for them; but if they turn away, All Œh will punish them with a 
painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter.  And there 
will not be for them on earth any protector or helper.
75.And among them are those who made a c ovenant with All Œh, 
[saying], "If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely
spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous."
76.But when He gave them from His bounty, they were stingy 
with it and turned away while they refused.
77.SoHe penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the 
Day they will meet Him –because they failed AllŒh in what 
they promised Him and because they [habitually] used to lie.
78.Did they not know that All Œh knows their secrets and their private 
conve rsations and that All Œh is the Knower of the unseen?
79.Those who criticize the contributors among the believers 
concerning [their] charities and [criticize] the ones who find 
nothing [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicule them –
AllŒh will ridi cule them, and they will have a painful punishment.
                                               
455i.e., the murder of Prophet Muúammad ( ).456i.e., for no reason.  On the contrary, they should have been grateful.

Page 203:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 10
18180.Ask forgiveness for them, [O Muúammad ], or do not ask 
forgiveness for them.  If you should ask forgiveness for them 
seventy times –never will AllŒh forgive them.  That is because
they disbelieved in AllŒh and His Messenger, and AllŒh does 
not guide the defiantly disobedient people.
81.Those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying [at home]
after [the departure of] the Messenger of All Œh and disliked to 
strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of AllŒh 
and said, "Do not go forth in the heat."  Say, "The fire of Hell 
is more intense in heat" –if they would but understand.
82.So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense 
for what they used to earn.
83.If AllŒh should return you to a faction of them [after the 
expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to 
battle], say, "You will not go out with me, ever, and you will 
never fight with me an enemy.  Indeed, you were satisfied 
with sitting [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those 
who stay behind."
84.And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muúammad ], over any 
of them who has died –ever –or stand at his grave.  Indeed, 
they disbelieved in AllŒh and His Messenger and died while 
they were defiantly di sobedient.
85.And let not their wealth and their children impress you.  All Œh 
only intends to punish them through them in this world and 
that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.
86.And when a s´rah was revealed [enjoining th em] to believe in 
AllŒh and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among 
them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, "Leave us 
to be with them who sit [at home]."
87.They were satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and 
their hearts were sealed over, so they do not understand.
88.But the Messenger and those who believed with him fought 
with their wealth and their lives.  Those will have [all that is] 
good, and it is those who are the successful.

Page 204:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
18289.AllŒh has prepared for them gardens b eneath which rivers flow,
wherein they will abide eternally.  That is the great attainment.
90.And those with excuses among the bedouins came to be 
permitted [to remain], and they who had lied457to AllŒh and 
His Messenger sat [at home].  There will strike those who 
disbelieved among them a painful punishment.
91.There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who 
do not find anything to spend any discomfort [i.e., guilt] when 
they are sincere to AllŒh and His Messenger.  There is not  
upon the doers of good any cause [for blame].  And AllŒh is 
Forgiving and Merciful.
92.Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you
that you might give them mounts, you said, "I can find nothing 
for you to ride upon."  They turned back while their eyes 
overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find 
something to spend [for the cause of All Œh].
93.The cause [for blame] is only upon those who ask permission 
of you while they are rich.  They are satisfied to be with those 
who stay behind, and AllŒh has sealed over their hearts, so 
they do not know.
94.They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them.   
Say, "Make no excuse –never will we believe you.  All Œh has 
already informed us of your news [i.e., affair].  And All Œh will 
observe your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger; then you 
will be taken back to the Knower of the unseen and the 
witnessed,458and He will inform you of what you used to do."
95.They will swear by All Œh to you when you return to them that 
you would leave them alone .  So leave them alone; indeed 
they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what 
they had been earning.
96.They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them.  
                                               
457i.e., claimed faith.458See footnotes to 6:73.

Page 205:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
183But if you should be satisfied with them –indeed, All Œh is not 
satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people.
97.The bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more 
likely not to know the limits of what [laws] All Œh has revealed 
to His Messenger.  And All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
98.And among the bedouins are some who consider what they 
spend as a loss459and await for you turns of misfortune.  Upon 
them will be a misfortune of evil.  And AllŒh is Hearing and 
Knowing.
99.But among the bedouins are some who believe in All Œh and the
Last Day and consider what they spend as means of nearness 
to AllŒh and of [obtaining] invocations of the Messenger.  
Unquestionably, it is a means of nearness for them.  All Œh will 
admit them to His mercy.  Indeed, AllŒh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
100.And the first forerunners [in the fait h] among the MuhŒjireen460
and the An§Œr461and those who followed them with good 
conduct –AllŒh is pleased with them and they are pleased 
with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever.  That is the 
great attainment.
101.And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, 
and [also] from the people of Mad¥nah.  They have become 
accustomed to hypocrisy.  You, [O Muúammad ], do not know 
them, [but] We know them.  We will punish them twice [in 
this world]; then they will be returned to a great punishment.
102.And [there are] others who have acknowledged their sins.  
They had mixed [i.e., polluted] a righteous deed with another 
                                               
459i.e., a fine or penalty.460Those who emigrated from Makkah and settled in Mad¥nah for the cause 
of Isl Œm.461The inhabitants of Mad¥nah who had accepted IslŒm and assisted the 
Prophet () and other emigrants upon their arrival there.

Page 206:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
184that was bad.462  Perhaps All Œh will turn to them in forgiveness.   
Indeed , AllŒh is Forgiving and Merciful.
103.Take, [O Muúammad ], from their wealth a charity by which 
you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [All Œh's 
blessings] upon them.  Indeed, your invocations are reassurance
for them.  And All Œh is Hearing an d Knowing.
104.Do they not know that it is All Œh who accepts repentance from 
His servants and receives charities and that it is All Œh who is 
the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful?
105.And say, "Do [as you will], for All Œh will see your deeds, and 
[sowill] His Messenger and the believers.  And you will be 
returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and 
He will inform you of what you used to do."
106.And [there are] others deferred until the command of AllŒh –
whether He will punish them o r whether He will forgive them.   
And All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
107.And [there are] those [hypocrites] who took for themselves a 
mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among 
the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against 
AllŒh and His Messenger before.  And they will surely swear, 
"We intended only the best."  And AllŒh testifies that indeed 
they are liars.
108.Do not stand [for prayer] within it –ever.  A mosque founded 
on righteousness from the first day463is more worthy for y ou 
to stand in.  Within it are men who love to purify themselves; 
and All Œh loves those who purify themselves.
109.Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on 
righteousness [with fear] from All Œh and [seeking] His approval
better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the 
edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into
the fire of Hell?  And AllŒh does not guide the wrongdoing 
people.
                                               
462This refers to their having previously taken part in jihŒd but having 
abstained on the occasion of Tab´k.463This description is of the QubŒÕ mosque.

S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
185110.Their building which they built will not cease to be a [cause of] 
skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut [i.e., stopped].   
And All Œh is Knowing and Wise.
111.Indeed, All Œh has purchased from the believers their lives and 
their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise.  
They fight in the cause of AllŒh,so they kill and are killed.  
[It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the 
Gospel and the QurÕ Œn.  And who is truer to his covenant than 
AllŒh?  So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted.   
And it is that which is the grea t attainment.
112.[Such believers are] the repentant, the worshippers, the 
praisers [of AllŒh], the travelers [for His cause], those who 
bow and prostrate [in prayer], those who enjoin what is right 
and forbid what is wrong, and those who observe the limits 
[set by] All Œh.  And give good tidings to the believers.
113.It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask 
forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, 
after it has become clear to them that they are companions of 
Hellfi re.
114.And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was 
only because of a promise he had made to him.  But when it 
became apparent to him [i.e., Abraham] that he [i.e., the father]
was an enemy to AllŒh, he disassociated himself from him.  
Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient.
115.And AllŒh would not let a people stray after He has guided 
them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid.  
Indeed, All Œh is Knowing of all things.
116.Indeed, to All Œh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
earth; He gives life and causes death.  And you have not 
besides All Œh any protector or any helper.
117.AllŒh has already forgiven the Prophet and the MuhŒjireen and 
the An§Œr who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the
hearts ofa party of them had almost inclined [to doubt], and 
then He forgave them.  Indeed, He was to them Kind and 
Merciful.

S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
186118.And [He also forgave] the three who were left alone [i.e., 
boycotted, and then regretted their error] to the point that the 
earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness464and their 
souls confined [i.e., anguished] them and they were certain 
that there is no refuge from AllŒh except in Him.  Then He 
turned to them so they could repent.  Indeed, AllŒh is the 
Accepting of repentance, th e Merciful.
119.O you who have believed, fear AllŒh and be with those who 
are true.
120.It was not [proper] for the people of Mad¥nah and those 
surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind 
after [the departure of] the Messenger of AllŒh or that they 
prefer themselves over his self.465  That is because they are not 
afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of AllŒh,
nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers, 
nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but thatit is 
registered for them as a righteous deed.  Indeed, AllŒh does 
not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good.
121.Nor do they spend an expenditure, small or large, or cross a 
valley but that it is registered for them that All Œh may reward 
them for the best of what they were doing.
122.And it is not for the believers to go forth [to battle] all at once.  
For there should separate from every division of them a group 
[remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn 
[i.e., advise] their people when they return to them that they 
might be cautious.
123.O you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the 
disbelievers and let them find in you harshness.  And know 
that All Œh is with the righteous.
124.And whenever a s´rah is reveal ed, there are among them 
[i.e., the hypocrites] those who say, "Which of you has this 
                                               
464Thus it seemed to them in their extreme distress.465In times of hardship.  Rather, they should have been willing to endure 
with the Prophet () whatever was necessary for Isl Œm.

Page 209:
S´rah 9–at-Tawbah JuzÕ 11
187increased in faith?"  As for those who believed, it has increased
them in faith, while they are rejoicing.
125.But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it has [only ] 
increased them in evil [in addition] to their evil.466  And they 
will have died while they are disbelievers.
126.Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice 
but then they do not repent nor do they remember?
127.And whenever a s´rah is re vealed, they look at each other, 
[saying], "Does anyone see you?" and then they dismiss 
themselves.  All Œh has dismissed their hearts because they are 
a people who do not understand.
128.There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among 
yourselves.  Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] 
concerned over you [i.e., your guidance] and to the believers 
is kind and merciful.
129.But if they turn away, [O Muúammad ], say, "Sufficient for me 
is All Œh; there is no deity except Him.  On Him I have relied,
and He is the Lord of the Great Throne."
                                               
466Literally, "filth," i.e., disbelief and hypocrisy.

1.Alif, LŒm, RŒ.468  These are the verses of the wise469Book.
2.Have the people been amazed that We revealed [revelation] to a 
man from among them, [saying], "Warn mankind a nd give good 
tidings to those who believe that they will have a [firm] precedence
of honor470with their Lord"?  [But] the disbelievers say, "Indeed,
this is an obvious magician."
3.Indeed, your Lord is All Œh, who created the heavens and the earth
in six days and then established Himself above the Throne,471
arranging the matter [of His creation].  There is no intercessor
except after His permission.  That is All Œh, your Lord, so worship
Him.  Then will you not remember?
4.To Him is your return all together . [It is] the promise of All Œh 
[which is] truth.  Indeed, He begins the [process of] creation and 
then repeats it that He may reward those who have believed and 
done righteous deeds, in justice.  But those who disbelieved will 
have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what
they used to deny.
5.It is H e who made the sun a shining light and the moon a 
derived light and determined for it phases –that you may know 
the number of years and account [of time].  All Œh has not created
this except i n truth.  He details the signs for a people who know.
6.Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and [in] what 
AllŒh has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a 
people who fear All Œh.

1897.Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are 
satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and 
those who are heedless of Our signs –
8.For those their refuge will be the Fire because of what they 
used to earn.
9.Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds –
their Lord will guide them because of their faith.  Beneath 
them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure.
10.Their call therein will be, "Exalted are You, O AllŒh," and 
their greeting therein will be, "Peace."  And the last of their 
call will b e, "Praise to All Œh, Lord of the worlds!"
11.And if All Œh was to hasten for the people the evil [they invoke]472
as He hastens for them the good, their term would have been 
ended for them.473  But We leave the ones who do not expect 
the meeting with Us, in th eir transgression, wandering blindly.
12.And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether 
lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove 
from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he 
had never called upon Us to [ remove] an affliction that touched
him.  Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which 
they have been doing.
13.And We had already destroyed generations before you when 
they wronged, and their messengers had come to them with 
clear proofs, but they were not to believe.  Thus do We 
recompense the criminal people.
14.Then We made you successors in the land after them so that 
We may observe how you will do.
15.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
those who do not expect the me eting with Us say, "Bring us a 
QurÕŒn other than this or change it."  Say, [O Muúammad ], "It 
is not for me to change it on my own accord.  I only follow 
                                               
472In anger or in heedlessness.473i.e., All Œh would have destroyed them on account of that.

Page 212:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
190what is revealed to me.  Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my 
Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day ."
16.Say, "If AllŒh had willed, I would not have recited it to you, 
nor would He have made it known to you, for I had remained 
among you a lifetime before it.474  Then will you not reason?"
17.So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about AllŒh 
ordenies His signs?  Indeed, the criminals will not succeed.
18.And they worship other than AllŒh that which neither harms 
them nor benefits them, and they say, "These are our intercessors
with All Œh."  S ay, "Do you inform All Œh of something He does 
not know in the heavens or on the earth?"  Exalted is He and 
high above what they associate with Him.
19.And mankind was not but one community [united in religion], 
but [then] they differed.  And if not for a word475that preceded
from your Lord, it would have been judged between them 
[immediately] concerning that over which they differ.
20.And they say, "Why is a sign not sent down to him from his 
Lord?"  So say, "The unseen is only for All Œh [to administer], 
so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."
21.And when We give the people a taste of mercy after adversity 
has touched them, at once they conspire against Our verses.  
Say, "AllŒh is swifter in strategy."  Indeed, Our messengers 
[i.e., angels] record that which you conspire.
22.It is He who enab les you to travel on land and sea until, when 
you are in ships and they sail with them476by a good wind and 
they rejoice therein, there comes a storm wind and the waves 
come upon them from everywhere and they assume that they 
are surrounded [i.e., doomed], supplicating AllŒh, sincere to 
                                               
474The Prophet () lived among his people forty years before receiving any 
revelation.475AllŒh's decree to allow time on earth for His creation or not to punish 
anyone before evidence has come to him.476The change in pronoun from the second to third person shows that the 
following description applies specifically to the disbelievers.

Page 213:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
191Him in religion, "If You should save us from this, we will surely
be among the thankful."
23.But when He saves them, at once they commit injustice477
upon the earth without right.  O mankind, your injustice is only
against yourselves, [being merely] the enjoyment of worldly 
life.  Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of 
what you used to do.
24.The example of [this] worldly life is but like rain which We 
have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth 
abso rb –[those] from which men and livestock eat –until, 
when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified 
and its people suppose that they have capability over it, there 
comes to it Our command by night or by day, and We make it 
as a harvest,478as if it had not flourished yesterday.  Thus do 
We explain in detail the signs for a people who give thought.
25.And AllŒh invites to the Home of Peace [i.e., Paradise] and 
guides whom He wills to a straight path.
26.For them who have done good is the best [reward] –and extra .479  
No darkness will cover their faces, nor humiliation.  Those are 
companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.
27.But they who have earned [blame for] evil doings –the 
recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliation 
will cover them.  They will have from AllŒh no protector.  It 
will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night –
so dark [are they].  Those are the companions of the Fire; they 
will abide therein eternally.
28.And [mention, O Muú ammad ], the Day We will gather them 
all together –then We will say to those who associated others 
with All Œh, "[Remain in] your place, you and your 'partners. '"480  
                                               
477By oppression and disobedience or by invoking others besides All Œh.478Its vegetation having been cut down or uprooted, i.e., utterly destroyed.479In addition to the pleasures of Paradise, they will be able to see AllŒh 
(subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ),as reported in an authentic úad¥th narrated by Muslim.480Those they had associated with All Œh.

Page 214:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
192Then We will separate them,481and their "partners" will say, 
"You did not used to worship us,482
29.And sufficient is All Œh as a witness between us and you that 
we were of your worship unaware."
30.There, [on that Day], every soul will be put to trial for what it 
did previously, and they will be returned to All Œh, their master,
the Truth, and lost from them is whatever they used to invent.
31.Say, "Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth?  
Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living 
out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who 
arranges [every] matter?"  They will say, "AllŒh," so say, 
"Then will you not fear Him?"
32.For that is AllŒh, your Lord, the Truth.  And what can be 
beyond truth except error?  So how are you averted?
33.Thus the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord has come into effect 
upon those wh o defiantly disobeyed –that they will not believe.
34.Say, "Are there of your 'partners' any who begins creation and 
then repeats it?"  Say, "All Œh begins creation and then repeats 
it, so how are you deluded?"
35.Say, "Are there of your 'partners' any w ho guides to the truth?"   
Say, "All Œh guides to the truth.  So is He who guides to the truth
more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is
guided?   Then what is [wrong] with you –how do you judge?"
36.And most of them follow not except assumption.  Indeed, 
assumption avails not against the truth at all.  Indeed, All Œh is 
Knowing of what they do.
37.And it was not [possible] for this QurÕŒn to be produced by 
other than All Œh, but [it is] a confirmation of what was before 
it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about 
                                               
481From the believers.482The inanimate objects, such as idols, will not have been aware of their 
worship of them.  But those beings who consented to be worshipped will 
lie and deny it on the Day of Judgement.

Page 215:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
193which there is no doubt,483from the Lord of the worlds.
38.Or do they say [about the Prophet ()], "He invented it?"  
Say, "Then bring forth a s´rah like it and call upon [for assistance]
whomever you can besides AllŒh, if you should be truthful."
39.Rather, they have denied that which they encompass not in 
knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them.  
Thus did those before them deny.  Then observe how was the 
end of the wrongdoers.
40.And of the m are those who believe in it, and of them are those 
who do not believe in it.  And your Lord is most knowing of 
the corrupters.
41.And if they deny you, [O Muúammad ], then say, "For me are 
my deeds, and for you are your deeds.  You are disassociated 
from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do."
42.And among them are those who listen to you.  But can you 
cause the deaf to hear [i.e., benefit from this hearing], although
they will not use reason?
43.And among them are those who look at you.  B ut can you guide
the blind although they will not [attempt to] see?
44.Indeed, AllŒh does not wrong the people at all, but it is the 
people who are wronging themselves.
45.And on the Day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if 
they had not remained [in the world] but an hour of the day, 
[and] they will know each other.  Those will have lost who 
denied the meeting with All Œh and were not guided.
46.And whether We show you some of what We promise them, 
[O Muúammad ], or We take you in death, to Us is t heir return;
then, [either way], All Œh is a witness concerning what they are 
doing.
47.And for every nation is a messenger.  So when their messenger
comes,484it will be judged between them in justice, and they 
                                               
483This phrase refers back to the QurÕ Œn.484To witness on the Day of Judgement.  Another meaning is "Once a messenger
has come [to them in this world]..."

Page 216:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
194will not be wronged.
48.And they say, "When is [the fulfillment of] this promise, if 
you should be truthful?"
49.Say, "I possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what 
AllŒh should will.  For every nation is a [specified] term.  
When their time has come, then they will not remain behind 
an hour, nor will they precede [it]."
50.Say, "Have you considered:  if His punishment should come 
to you by night or by day –for which [aspect] of it would the 
criminals be impatient?"485
51.Then is it that when it has [actually] occurred you will believe 
init?  Now?486  And you were [once] for it impatient.487
52.Then it will be said to those who had wronged, "Taste the 
punishment of eternity; are you being recompensed except for 
what you used to earn?"
53.And they ask information of you, [O Muúammad ], "Is it true?"  
Say, "Yes, by my Lord.  Indeed, it is truth; and you will not 
cause failure [to All Œh]."
54.And if each soul that wronged had everything on earth, it 
would offer it in ransom.  And they will confide regret when 
they see the punishment; and they will be judged in justice, 
and they will not be wronged.
55.Unquestionably, to AllŒh belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and the earth.  Unquestionably, the promise of AllŒh is truth, 
but most of them do not know.
56.He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.
57.O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord 
and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy 
for the believers.
                                               
485"Impatience" refers to the disbelievers' ridicule of the Prophet () by 
telling him to produce All Œh's punishment as proof of his truthfulness.486i.e., when it is too late to benefit from belief.487Challenging those who warned of it to bring it on immediately.

Page 217:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
19558.Say, "In the bounty of AllŒh and in His mercy –in that let 
them rejoice; it is b etter than what they accumulate."
59.Say, "Have you seen what AllŒh has sent down to you of 
provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] 
unlawful?"  Say, "Has AllŒh permitted you [to do so], or do 
you invent [something] about All Œh?"
60.And what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood
about AllŒh on the Day of Resurrection?488  Indeed, AllŒh is 
full of bounty to the people, but most of them are not grateful.
61.And, [O Muúammad ], you are not [engaged] in any matter or 
recite any of the QurÕ Œn and you [people] do not do any deed 
except that We are witness over you when you are involved in 
it.  And not absent from your Lord is any [part] of an atom's 
weight489within the earth or within the heaven or [anything] 
smaller than that or gr eater but that it is in a clear register.
62.Unquestionably, [for] the allies of AllŒh there will be no fear 
concerning them, nor will they grieve –
63.Those who believed and were fearing All Œh.
64.For them are good tidings in the worldly life and in th e Hereafter.   
No change is there in the words [i.e., decrees] of All Œh.  That 
is what is the great attainment.
65.And let not their speech grieve you.  Indeed, honor [due to power] 
belongs to All Œh entirely.  He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
66.Unquestion ably, to AllŒh belongs whoever is in the heavens 
and whoever is on the earth.  And those who invoke other than 
AllŒh do not [actually] follow [His] "partners."  They follow 
not except assumption, and they are not but falsifying.
67.It is He who made for y ou the night to rest therein and the day,
giving sight.490  Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen.
                                               
488i.e., what do they think He will do with them.489Or "the weight of a small ant."490i.e., making things visible.

Page 218:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
19668.They491have said, "All Œh has taken a son."  Exalted is He; He 
is the [one] Free of need.  To Him belongs whatever is in the 
heavens and whatever is in the earth.  You have no authority 
for this [claim].  Do you say about AllŒh that which you do 
not know?
69.Say, "Indeed, those who invent falsehood about All Œh will not 
succeed."
70.[For them is brief] enjoyment in this world; then to Us is their 
return; then We will make them taste the severe punishment 
because they used to disbelieve.
71.And recite to them the news of Noah, when he said to his people,
"O my people, if my residence and my reminding of the signs 
of AllŒh has become burdensome upon you –then I have 
relied upon All Œh.  So resolve upon your plan and [call upon] 
your associates.  Then let not your plan be obscure to you.492  
Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite.
72.And if you turn away [from my advice] –then no payment 
have I asked of you.  My reward is only from All Œh, and I have
been commanded to be of the Muslims [i.e., those who submit 
to All Œh]."
73.And they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in 
the ship and made them successors, and We drowned those 
who denied Our signs.  Then see how was the end of those who 
were warned.
74.Then We sent after him messengers to their peoples, and they 
came to them with clear proofs.  But they were not to believe 
in that which they had denied before.493  Thus We seal over
the hearts of the transgressors.
75.Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his 
                                               
491The Christians and others.492i.e., Do not let it be a source of doubt or anxiety to you but let it be clear, 
open and defined.493i.e., the succeeding generations were persistent in disbelief.

Page 219:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
197establishment with Our signs, but they behaved arrogantly and 
were a criminal people.
76.So when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, 
"Indeed, thi s is obvious magic."
77.Moses said, "Do you say [thus] about the truth when it has 
come to you?  Is this magic?  But magicians will not succeed."
78.They said, "Have you come to us to turn us away from that 
upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may 
have grandeur in the land?  And we are not believers in you."
79.And Pharaoh said, "Bring to me every learned magician."
80.So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, "Throw down
whatever you will throw."
81.And when they had thrown, Moses said, "What you have brought
is [only] magic.  Indeed, AllŒh will expose its worthlessness.  
Indeed, All Œh does not amend the work of corrupters.
82.And AllŒh will establish the truth by His words, even if the 
criminals dislike it."
83.But no one believ ed Moses, except [some] offspring [i.e., youths]
among his people, for fear of Pharaoh and his establishment that 
they would persecute them.  And indeed, Pharaoh was haughty
within the land, and indeed, he was of the transgressors.
84.And Moses said, "O m y people, if you have believed in All Œh, 
then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims [i.e., submitting
to Him]."
85.So they said, "Upon All Œh do we rely.  Our Lord, make us not 
[objects of] trial for the wrongdoing people
86.And save us by Your mercy fr om the disbelieving people."
87.And We inspired to Moses and his brother, "Settle your people
in Egypt in houses and make your houses [facing the] qiblah494
and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers."
                                               
494In order that th ey might pray therein unseen by their enemy.

Page 220:
S´rah 10–Y´nus JuzÕ 11
19888.And Moses said, "Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh 
and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life, 
our Lord, that they may lead [men] astray from Your way.  
Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that 
they will not believe until they see the painf ul punishment."
89.[AllŒh] said, "Your supplication has been answered."495  So 
remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who 
do not know."
90.And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh
and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, 
when drowning overtook him, he said, "I believe that there is 
no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, 
and I am of the Muslims."
91.Now?  And you had disobeyed [Him] before and were of the 
corrupters?
92.So toda y We will save you in body496that you may be to those 
who succeed you a sign.  And indeed, many among the people, 
of Our signs, are heedless.
93.And We had certainly settled the Children of Israel in an 
agreeable settlement and provided them with good thin gs.  And
they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them.  
Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of 
Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
94.So if you are in doubt, [O Muúammad ], about that which We 
have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading 
the Scripture before you.  The truth has certainly come to you 
from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.
95.And never be of those who deny the signs of All Œh and [thus] 
be among the losers.497
                                               
495Literally, "the supplication of both of you," i.e., that of Moses and of 
Aaron, who joined by saying, " meen " ("O All Œh, respond").496i.e., his dead body will be preserved and not destroyed.497Among the interpretations of the last two verses is that they were meant 
to stir the Prophet () to declare and confirm his certainty, which he did.  
Another is that al though the words are addressed to the Prophet ( ), they 
are directed to all people.

19996.Indeed, those upon whom the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord 
has come into effect will not believe,
97.Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the 
painful punishment.
98.Then has there not been a [single] city that believed so its faith
benefited it except the people of Jonah?  When they believed, 
We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly 
life and gave them enjoyment [i.e., provision] for a time.
99.And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed –
all of them entirely.  Then, [O Muúammad ], would you compel
the people in order that they become believers?
100.And it is not for a soul [i.e., anyone] to believe except by 
permission of AllŒh, and He will place defilement498upon 
those who will not use reason.
101.Say, "Observe what is in the heavens and the earth."  But of no 
avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe.
102.So do they wait except for like [what occurred in] the days of 
those who passed on before them?  Say, "Then wait; indeed, I 
am with you among those who wait."
103.Then We will save Our messengers and those who have believed.   
Thus, it is an obligation upon Us that We save the believers.499
104.Say, [O Muúammad ], "O people, if you are in doubt as to my 
religion –then I do not worship those which you worship 
besides AllŒh; but I worship AllŒh, who causes your death.  
And I have been commanded to be of the believers
105.And [commanded], 'Direct your face [i.e., self] toward the 
religion, inclining to truth, and never be of tho se who associate
others with All Œh;
106.And do not invoke besides AllŒh that which neither benefits 
                                               
498Among its meanings are filth, wrath, punishment, disbelief, confusion 
and error.499From All Œh's punishment.

200you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be 
of the wrongdoers. '"500
107.And if AllŒh should touch you with adversity, there is no 
remover ofit except Him; and if He intends for you good, 
then there is no repeller of His bounty.  He causes it to reach 
whom He wills of His servants.  And He is the Forgiving, the 
Merciful.
108.Say, "O mankind, the truth has come to you from your Lord, 
so whoeve r is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his 
soul, and whoever goes astray only goes astray [in violation] 
against it.  And I am not over you a manager."
109.And follow what is revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], and be 
patient until All Œh will judge.  And He is the best of judges.

1.Alif, LŒm, RŒ.502  [This is] a Book whose verses are perfected 
and then presented in detail from [one who is] Wise and Acquainted
2.[Through a messenger, saying], "Do not worship excep t AllŒh.  
Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good 
tidings,"
3.And [saying], "Seek forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him,
[and] He will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified 
term and give every doer of favor his favor [i.e ., reward].  But if 
you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a 
great Day.
4.To All Œh is your return, and He is over all things competent."
5.Unquestionably, they [i.e., the disbelievers] turn away their breasts 
to hide themselves from him.  Unquestionably, [even] when they
cover themselves in their clothing, He [i.e., AllŒh] knows what 
they conceal and what they declare.  Indeed, He is Knowing of 
that within the breasts.
6.And there is no creature on earth but that upon All Œh is its p rovision,
and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage.503  All 
is in a clear register.
7.And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days –
and His Throne had been upon water –that He might test you as 
to which of you is best in d eed.  But if you say, "Indeed, you are 
resurrected after death," those who disbelieve will surely say, 
"This is not but obvious magic."
8.And if We hold back from them the punishment for a limited time,
they will surely say,504"What detains it?"  Unquestio nably, on

202the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, 
and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
9.And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We 
withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful.
10.But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched 
him, he will surely say, "Bad times have left me."  Indeed, he 
is exultant and boastful –
11.Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds; those 
will have forgiveness and great r eward.
12.Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed 
to you,505or is your breast constrained by it because they say, 
"Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come 
with him an angel?"  But you are only a warner.  And All Œh is
Disposer of all things.
13.Or do they say, "He invented it"?  Say, "Then bring ten s´rahs 
like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] 
whomever you can besides All Œh, if you should be truthful."
14.And if they do not respond to you –then know that it [i.e., the 
QurÕŒn] was revealed with the knowledge of All Œh506and that 
there is no deity except Him.  Then,507would you [not] be 
Muslims?
15.Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments –
We fully repay them for their deeds the rein,508and they therein
will not be deprived.
16.Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but 
the Fire.  And lost is what they did therein,509and worthless is 
what they used to do.
                                               
505Knowing of the Prophet's difficulties, All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) urges 
him to patience, certain that he would not fail to convey the message in 
its entirety.506i.e., that knowledge which no one possesses except Him ( subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ).507After having been convinced by such evidence.508i.e., during worldly life.509i.e., during worldly life.

20317.So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord 
[like the aforementioned]?  And a witness510from Him follows
it,511and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as 
mercy.  Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in 
it [i.e., the QurÕŒn].  But whoever disbelieves in it from the 
[various] factions –the Fire is his promised destination.  So be 
not in doubt about it.  Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, 
but most of the people do not believe.
18.And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about All Œh?  
Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses 
will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord."  
Unquestionably, the curse of All Œh is upon the wrongdoers
19.Who averted [people] from the way of AllŒh and sought to 
make it [seem] deviant while they, conc erning the Hereafter, 
were disbelievers.
20.Those were not causing failure [to All Œh] on earth, nor did they
have besides AllŒh any protectors.  For them the punishment 
will be multiplied.  They were not able to hear, nor did they 
see.512
21.Those are the ones who will have lost themselves, and lost 
from them is what they used to invent.
22.Assuredly, it is they in the Hereafter who will be the greatest 
losers.
23.Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds and 
humbled themselves to their Lord –those are the companions 
of Paradise; they will abide eternally therein.
24.The example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf, and 
the seeing and hearing.  Are they equal in comparison?  Then, 
will you not remember?
25.And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, [saying], 
"Indeed, I am to you a clear warner
                                               
510Referring to Prophet Muúammad ( ) or to the angel Gabriel.511Testifying to its truth.  Additionally, it can mean "recites it," i.e., the QurÕ Œn.512They refused to listen to the truth or to perceive it.

20426.That you not worship except All Œh.  Indeed, I fear for you the 
punishment of a painful day."
27.So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people 
said, "We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we 
do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of 
us [and] at first suggestion.513  And we do not see in you over 
us any merit; rather, we think you are liars."
28.He said, "O my people, have you considered:  if I should be 
upon clear evidence from my Lord while He has given me 
mercy from Himself but it has been made unapparent to you, 
should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?
29.And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth.  My 
reward is not but from All Œh.  And I am not one to drive away 
those who have believed.  Indeed, they will meet their Lord, 
but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.
30.And O my people, who would protect me from AllŒh if I 
drove them away?  Then will you not be reminded?
31.And I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing 
the provision] of All Œh or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell 
you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your 
eyes look down that AllŒh will never grant them any good.  
AllŒh is most knowing of what is within their souls.  Indeed, I 
would then be among the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust]."
32.They said, "O Noah, you have disputed [i.e., opposed] us and 
been frequent in dispute of us.  So bring us what you threate n 
us, if you should be of the truthful."
33.He said, "AllŒh will only bring it to you if He wills, and you 
will not cause [Him] failure.
34.And my advice will not benefit you –although I wished to 
advise you –if All Œh should intend to put you in error.   He is 
your Lord, and to Him you will be returned."
                                               
513i.e., without any thought or hesitation.

S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
20535.Or do they say [about Prophet Muúammad ()], "He invented
it"?  Say, "If I have invented it, then upon me is [the consequence
of] my crime; but I am innocent of what [crimes] you commit."
36.And it was revealed to Noah that, "No one will believe from 
your people except those who have already be lieved, so do not 
be distressed by what they have been doing.
37.And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration
and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; 
indeed, they are [to be] drowned."
38.And he constructed the ship, and whenever an assembly of the 
eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him.  He 
said, "If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you 
ridicule.
39.And you are going to know who will get a punishment that 
will disgrace him [on earth ] and upon whom will descend an 
enduring punishment [in the Hereafter]."
40.[So it was], until when Our command came and the oven 
overflowed,514We said, "Load upon it [i.e., the ship] of each 
[creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom
the word [i.e., decree] has preceded, and [include] whoever 
has believed."  But none had believed with him, except a few.
41.And [Noah] said, "Embark therein; in the name of All Œh is its 
course and its anchorage.  Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and 
Merciful."
42.And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and 
Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], "O my son, 
come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers."
43.[But] he said, "I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me 
from the w ater."  [Noah] said, "There is no protector today from 
the decree of All Œh, except for whom He gives mercy."  And the 
waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.
                                               
514As a sign to Noah of the imminence of the fl ood.  The tann´r is a large, 
rounded oven.  The word can also mean the earth's lowlands.

Page 228:
S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
20644.And it was said, "O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, 
withhold [your rain]. "  And the water subsided, and the matter 
was accomplished, and it [i.e., the ship] came to rest on the 
[mountain of] J´diyy.  And it was said, "Away with the 
wrongdoing people."
45.And Noah called to his Lord and said, "My Lord, indeed my 
son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is true; and 
You are the most just of judges!"
46.He said, "O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he 
is [one whose] work was other than righteous, so ask Me not 
for that about which you have no knowledge.  Indeed, I advise 
you, lest you be among the ignorant."
47.[Noah] said, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that 
of which I have no knowledge.  And unless You forgive me 
and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers."
48.It was said, "O Noah, disemba rk in security from Us and blessings
upon you and upon nations [descending] from those with you.  
But other nations [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then 
there will touch them from Us a painful punishment."
49.That is from the news of the unseen which W e reveal to you, 
[O Muúammad ].  You knew it not, neither you nor your people,
before this.  So be patient; indeed, the [best] outcome is for 
the righteous.
50.And to ÔAad [We sent] their brother H´d.  He said, "O my people,
worship AllŒh; you have no deity other than Him.  You are 
not but inventors [of falsehood].
51.O my people, I do not ask you for it [i.e., my advice] any 
reward.  My reward is only from the one who created me.  
Then will you not reason?
52.And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then 
repent to Him.  He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in 
showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength.  
And do not turn away, [being] criminals."

Page 229:
S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
20753.They said, "O H´d, you have not brought us clear evidence, 
and we are not o nes to leave our gods on your say -so.  Nor are 
we believers in you.
54.We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with 
evil [i.e., insanity]."  He said, "Indeed, I call All Œh to witness, 
and witness [yourselves] that I am free from whatever you 
associate with All Œh
55.Other than Him.  So plot against me all together; then do not 
give me respite.
56.Indeed, I have relied upon AllŒh, my Lord and your Lord.  
There is no creature but that He holds its forelock [i.e., 
controls it].  Indeed, my Lord is on a path [that is] straight."
57.But if they turn away, [say], "I have already conveyed that 
with which I was sent to you.  My Lord will give succession 
to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all.  
Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian."
58.And when Our command came, We saved H´d and those who 
believed with him, by mercy from Us; and We saved them 
from a harsh punishment.
59.And that was ÔAad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and 
disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every 
obstinate tyrant.
60.And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse 
and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection.  Unquestionably, 
ÔAad denied their Lord; then away with ÔAad, the people of H´d.
61.And to Tham´d [We sent] their brother êŒliú.  He said, "O my 
people, worship All Œh; you have no deity other than Him.  He 
has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask 
forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him.  Indeed, my Lord 
is near and responsive."
62.They said, "OêŒliú, you were among us a man of promise 
before this.  Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers 
worshipped?  And indeed we are, about that to which you invite
us, in disquieting doubt."

Page 230:
S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
20863.He said, "O my people, have you considered:  if I should be 
upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me 
mercy from Himself, who would protect me from AllŒh if I 
disobeyed Him?  So you would not increase me except in loss.
64.And O my people, this is the she -camel of All Œh –[she is] to 
you a sign.  So let her feed upon All Œh's earth and do not touch
her with harm, or you will be taken by an impending punishment."
65.But they hamstrung her, so he said, "Enjoy yourselves in your 
homes for three days.  That is a promise not to be denied [i.e., 
unfailing]."
66.So when Our command came, We saved êŒliú and those who 
believed with him, by mercy from Us, and [saved them] from 
the disgrace of that day.515  Indeed, it is your Lord who is the 
Powerful, the Exalted in Might.
67.And the shriek516seized those who had wronged, and they 
became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone
68.As if they had never prospered therein.  Unquestionably, 
Tham´d denied their Lord; then, away with Tham´d.
69.And certainly did Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to Abraham
with good tidings; they said, "Peace."  He said, "Peace," and 
did not delay in bringing [them] a roasted calf.
70.But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he distrusted 
them and felt from them apprehension.517  They said, "Fear 
not.  We have been sent to the peo ple of Lot."
71.And his wife was standing, and she smiled.518  Then We gave 
her good tidings of Isaac and after Isaac, Jacob.
72.She said, "Woe to me!519  Shall I give birth while I am an old 
                                               
515The day of Tham´d's destruction.516A piercing cry or blast from the sky.517Traditionally, if a guest refused to eat, it meant that he harbored ill will 
toward the host or intended him harm.518In pleasure at the news of the forthcoming punishment of the evil people 
who denied Prophet Lot (upon him be peace).519An expression of surprise and amazement.

Page 231:
S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
209woman and this, my husband, is an old man?  Indeed, this is 
an ama zing thing!"
73.They said, "Are you amazed at the decree of All Œh?  May the 
mercy of AllŒh and His blessings be upon you, people of the 
house.  Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable."
74.And when the fright had left Abraham and the good tidings 
had reached him, he began to argue [i.e., plead] with Us520
concerning the people of Lot.
75.Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, grieving521and [frequently] 
returning [to All Œh].
76.[The angels said], "O Abraham, give up this [plea].  Indeed, 
the command of your Lord has come, and indeed, there will 
reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled."
77.And when Our messengers, [the angels], came to Lot, he was 
anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort522and 
said, "This is a trying day."
78.And his people came hastening to him, and before [this] they 
had been doing evil deeds.523  He said, "O my people, these 
are my daughters;524they are purer for you.  So fear All Œh and 
do not disgrace me concerning my guests.  Is there not among 
you a man of reason?"
79.They said, "You have already known that we have not concerning
your daughters [i.e., women] any claim [i.e., desire], and indeed, 
you know what we want."
80.He said, "If only I had against you some power or could take 
refuge in a strong support."
81.They [the angels] said, "O Lot, indeed we are messengers of 
your Lord; [therefore], they will never reach you.  So set out 
                                               
520i.e., with Our angels.521i.e., sighing or moaning during supplication out of grief for people and 
fear of All Œh.522Prophet Lot feared for the safety and honor of his guests.523Referring to their practice of sodomy and homosexual rape of males.524i.e., the women of his community who were available for marriage.

210with your family during a portion of the night525and let not 
any among you look back –except your wife; indeed, she will
be struck by that wh ich strikes them.  Indeed, their appointment
is [for] the morning.  Is not the morning near?"
82.So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of 
the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered 
hard clay, [which were]
83.Marked from your Lord.  And it [i.e., AllŒh's punishment] is 
not from the wrongdoers [very] far.
84.And to Madyan [We sent] their brother ShuÔayb.  He said, "O 
my people, worship All Œh; you have no deity other than Him.  
And do not decrease from the measure and the scal e.  Indeed, 
I see you in prosperity, but indeed, I fear for you the punishment
of an all -encompassing Day.
85.And O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and 
do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit 
abuse on the earth, spreadi ng corruption.
86.What remains [lawful] from All Œh is best for you, if you would
be believers.  But I am not a guardian over you."
87.They said, "O ShuÔayb, does your prayer [i.e., religion] 
command you that we should leave what our fathers worship 
or not do with our wealth what we please?  Indeed, you are 
the forbearing, the discerning!"526
88.He said, "O my people, have you considered:  if I am upon 
clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with a 
good provision from Him...?527  And I do not inten d to differ 
from you in that which I have forbidden you; I only intend 
reform as much as I amable.  And my success is not but
through All Œh.  Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return .528
                                               
525i.e., sometime befor e dawn.526This is a sarcastic description implying the opposite.527The conclusion of the sentence is estimated as "...would it not be my duty 
to warn you against corruption and disobedience?"528i.e., I turn to All Œh frequently in supplication and repentance.

S´rah 11–H´d JuzÕ 12
21189.And O my people, let not [your] dissension from me cause 
you tobe struck by that similar to what struck the people of 
Noah or the people of H´d or the people of êŒliú.  And the 
people of Lot are not from you far away.
90.And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him.  
Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affect ionate."
91.They said, "O ShuÔayb, we do not understand much of what 
you say, and indeed, we consider you among us as weak.  And 
if not for your family, we would have stoned you [to death]; 
and you are not to us one respected."
92.He said, "O my people, is my family more respected for power
by you than AllŒh?  But you put Him behind your backs [in 
neglect].  Indeed, my Lord is encompassing of what you do.
93.And O my people, work according to your position; indeed, I 
am working.  You are going to know towhom will come a 
punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar.  So watch;
indeed, I am with you a watcher, [awaiting the outcome]."
94.And when Our command came, We saved ShuÔayb and those 
who believed with him, by mercy from Us.  And the shriek 
seized those who had wronged, and they became within their 
homes [corpses] fallen prone
95.As if they had never prospered therein.  Then, away with Madyan
as Tham´d was taken away.
96.And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear 
authority
97.To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the 
command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not 
[at all] discerning.
98.He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and 
lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the place to which 
they are led.
99.And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the
Day of Resurrection.  And wretched is the gift529which is given.
                                               
529i.e., the curse which follows them in both worlds.

212100.That is from the news of the cities, which We relate to you; of 
them, some are [still] standing and some are [as] a harvest 
[mowed down].530
101.And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.  
And they were not availed at all by their gods which they 
invoked other than AllŒh when there came the command of 
your Lord.  And they did not increase them in o ther than ruin.
102.And thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the cities 
while they are committing wrong.  Indeed, His seizure is painful
and severe.
103.Indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of 
the Hereafter.  That is a Day for which the people will be 
collected, and that is a Day [which will be] witnessed.
104.And We do not delay it except for a limited term.
105.The Day it comes no soul will speak except by His permission.   
And among them will be the wretched and the pr osperous.
106.As for those who were [destined to be] wretched, they will be 
in the Fire.  For them therein is [violent] exhaling and inhaling .531
107.[They will be] abiding therein as long as the heavens and the 
earth endure, except what your Lord should w ill.  Indeed, your 
Lord is an effecter of what He intends.
108.And as for those who were [destined to be] prosperous, they 
will be in Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and 
the earth endure, except what your Lord should will –a 
bestowal uni nterrupted.
109.So do not be in doubt, [O Muúammad ], as to what these 
[polytheists] are worshipping.  They worship not except as 
their fathers worshipped before.  And indeed, We will give 
them their share undiminished.
110.And We had certainly given Mose s the Scripture, but it came 
                                               
530Their structures have been completely destroyed.531i.e., their sighs and sobs, resembling the bray of a donkey.

213under disagreement.  And if not for a word532that preceded 
from your Lord, it would have been judged between them.  
And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the QurÕŒn], in 
disquieting doubt.
111.And indeed, each [of the belie vers and disbelievers] –your 
Lord will fully compensate them for their deeds.  Indeed, He 
is Acquainted with what they do.
112.So remain on a right course as you have been commanded, 
[you] and those who have turned back with you [to AllŒh], 
and do not tr ansgress.  Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.
113.And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be 
touched by the Fire, and you would not have other than All Œh 
any protectors; then you would not be helped.
114.And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the 
approach of the night.  Indeed, good deeds do away with 
misdeeds.  That is a reminder for those who remember.
115.And be patient, for indeed, All Œh does not allow to be lost the 
reward of those who do good.
116.So why were there not533among the generations before you 
those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on 
earth –except a few of those We saved from among them?  
But those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given 
therein, and they were criminals.
117.And your Lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly 
while their people were reformers.
118.And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind 
one community; but they will not cease to differ,
119.Except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He 
created them.  But the word of your Lord is to be fulfilled that, 
"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together."

messengers is that by which We make firm your heart.  And 
there has come to you, in this, the truth and an instruction and 
a reminder for the believers.
121.And say to those who do not believe, "Work according to your 
position; indeed, we are working.
122.And wait; indeed, we are waiting."
123.And to AllŒh belong the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and 
the earth and to Him will be returned the matter, all of it, so 
worship Him and rely upon Him.  And your Lord is not 
unaware of that which you do.

BismillŒhir -RaúmŒnir -Raúeem
1.Alif, LŒm, RŒ.535  These are the verses of the clear Book.
2.Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic QurÕŒn536that you 
might understand.
3.We relate to you, [O Muúammad ], the best of stories in what 
We have revealed to you of this QurÕŒn although you were, 
before it, among the unaware .
4.[Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father,537"O 
my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the 
sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."
5.He said, "O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers 
or they w ill contrive against you a plan.  Indeed Satan, to man, 
is a manifest enemy.
6.And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation
of narratives [i.e., events or dreams] and complete His favor upon
you and upon the family of Jacob, as He c ompleted it upon your 
fathers before, Abraham and Isaac.  Indeed, your Lord is Knowing
and Wise."
7.Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those 
who ask, [such as]
8.When they said, "Joseph and his brother538are more beloved to 
our fath er than we, while we are a clan.  Indeed, our father is in 
clear error.
9.Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance 
[i.e., attention] of your father will [then] be only for you, and 
you will be after that a righteous people."539
                                               
534Y´suf :  (The Prophet) Joseph.535See footnote to 2:1.536i.e., revealed in the Arabic language.537The prophet Jacob (upon whom be peace).538Benjamin, who was born of the same mother as Joseph.539i.e., You can repent thereafter.

21610.Said a speaker among them, "Do not kill Joseph but throw him 
into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up –
if you would do [something]."
11.They said, "O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph
while indeed, we are to him sincere c ounselors?
12.Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play.  
And indeed, we will be his guardians."
13.[Jacob] said, "Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, 
and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him 
unaware."
14.They said, "If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] 
clan, indeed, we would then be losers."
15.So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the 
bottom of the well...540  But We inspired to him, "You will 
surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while 
they do not perceive [your identity]."
16.And they came to their father at night, weeping.
17.They said, "O our father, indeed we went racing each other and
left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him.  But you 
would not believe us, even if we were truthful."
18.And they brought upon his shirt false blood.541  [Jacob] said, 
"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience
is most fitting.  And AllŒh is the one sought for help against 
that which you describe."
19.And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their 
water drawer, and he let down his bucket.  He said, "Good news!   
Here is a boy."  And they concealed him, [taking him] as 
merchandise;542and All Œh was Knowing of what they did.
                                               
540The conclusion of this sentence is estimated to be "...they torm ented him."541They had stained Joseph's shirt with the blood of a lamb but had forgotten 
to tear it, thereby arousing their father's suspicion.542To be sold as a slave.

S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 12
21720.And they sol d him for a reduced price –a few dirhams –and 
they were, concerning him, of those content with little.
21.And the one from Egypt543who bought him said to his wife, 
"Make his residence comfortable.  Perhaps he will benefit us, 
or we will adopt him as a son."  And thus, We established 
Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation 
of events [i.e., dreams].  And AllŒh is predominant over His 
affair, b ut most of the people do not know.
22.And when he [i.e., Joseph] reached maturity, We gave him 
judgement and knowledge.  And thus We reward the doers of 
good.
23.And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him.  She 
closed the doors and said, "Come, you."  He said, "[I seek] the 
refuge of AllŒh.  Indeed, he544is my master, who has made 
good m y residence.  Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed."
24.And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would 
have inclined to her had he not seen the proof [i.e., sign] of his 
Lord.  And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil 
and immorality .  Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.
25.And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from 
the back, and they found her husband at the door.  She said, 
"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your 
wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"
26.[Joseph] said, "It was she who sought to seduce me."  And a 
witness from her family testified, "If his shirt is torn from the 
front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.
27.But if his shirt is torn from the b ack, then she has lied, and he 
is of the truthful."
28.So when he [i.e., her husband] saw his shirt torn from the back,
he said, "Indeed, it is of your [i.e., women's] plan.  Indeed, 
your plan is great [i.e., vehement].
                                               
543The minister in charge of supplies, whose title was al -ÔAzeez.544Her husband, al -ÔAzeez.

Page 240:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 12
21829.Joseph, ignore this.545  And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for 
your sin.  Indeed, you were of the sinful."
30.And women in the city said, "The wife of al -ÔAzeez is seeking 
to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love.  
Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error."
31.So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and
prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife 
and said [to Joseph], "Come out before them."  And when 
they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands546
and said, "Perfect is All Œh!547  This is not a man; this is none 
but a noble angel."
32.She said, "That is the one about whom you blamed me.  And I 
certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if 
he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned 
and will be of those debased."
33.He said, "My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to 
which they invite me.  And if You do not avert from me their plan,
I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant."
34.So his Lord responded to him and averted fro m him their plan.  
Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
35.Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs548that 
he [i.e., al -ÔAzeez] should surely imprison him for a time.549
36.And there entered the prison with him two young men.  One 
of them s aid, "Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing
wine."  The other said, "Indeed, I have seen myself carrying 
upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating.   
Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of 
those who do good ."
                                               
545i.e., conceal it and act as if it had not taken place.546So distracted were they at the sight of him.547In His ability to create such beauty.548Proofs of his innocence.549Until the scandal be forgotten.

Page 241:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 12
21937.He said, "You will not receive food that is provided to you 
except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it 
comes to you.  That is from what my Lord has taught me.  
Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe 
in All Œh, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.
38.And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob.  And it was not for us to associate anything 
with All Œh.  That is from the favor of All Œh upon us and upon 
the people, but most of the people are not grateful.
39.O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or 
AllŒh, the One, the Prevailing?
40.You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have 
named them,550you and your fathers, for which All Œh has sent 
down no authority.  Legislation is not but for AllŒh.  He has 
commanded that you worship not except Him.  That is the 
correct religion, but most of the people do not know.
41.O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give 
drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be 
crucified, and the birds will eat from his head.  The matter has 
been decreed about which you both inquire."
42.And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, 
"Mention me before your master."  But Satan made him fo rget 
the mention [to] his master, and he [i.e., Joseph] remained in 
prison several years.
43.And [subsequently] the king said, "Indeed, I have seen [in a 
dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, 
and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry.  
O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret
visions."
44.They said, "[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are 
not learned in the interpretation of dreams."
                                               
550The false objects of worship which you have called "god s."

Page 242:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
22045.But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, 
"I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth."
46.[He said], "Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven 
fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green 
spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry –that I may return 
to the people [i.e., the king and his court]; perhaps they will 
know [about you]."
47.[Joseph] said, "You will plant for seven years consecutively; 
and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from 
which you will eat.
48.Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will
consume what you advanced [i.e., saved] for them, except a 
little from which you will store.
49.Then will come after that a year in which the people will be 
given rain and in which they will press [oli ves and grapes]."
50.And the king said, "Bring him to me."  But when the messenger
came to him, [Joseph] said, "Return to your master and ask 
him what is the case of the women who cut their hands.  
Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan."
51.Said [the king to the women], "What was your condition when 
you sought to seduce Joseph?"  They said, "Perfect is All Œh!551  
We know about him no evil."  The wife of al-ÔAzeez said, 
"Now the truth has become evident.  It was I who sought to 
seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.
52.That is so he [i.e., al-ÔAzeez] will know that I did not betray 
him in [his] absence and that All Œh does not guide the plan of 
betrayers.
53.And I do not acquit myself.  Indeed, the soul is a persistent 
enjoiner of evil, except tho se upon which my Lord has mercy.  
Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."552
                                               
551In His ability to create such purity of character.552Although Ibn Katheer attributes the words of verses 52-53 to the wife of 
al-ÔAzeez, others have concluded that they were spoken by Joseph, 
thereby justifying his request for an inquiry and acknowledg ing AllŒh's 
mercy to him.

Page 243:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
22154.And the king said, "Bring him to me; I will appoint him 
exclusively for myself."  And when he spoke to him, he said, 
"Indeed, you are today established [in position] and tru sted."
55.[Joseph] said, "Appoint me over the storehouses of the land.  
Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian."
56.And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein
wherever he willed.  We touch with Our mercy whom We will,
and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do 
good.
57.And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed 
and were fearing All Œh.
58.And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they 
entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to th em
unknown.553
59.And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, 
"Bring me a brother of yours from your father.554  Do you not see
that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators?
60.But if you do not bring him to me, no measur e will there be 
[hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me."
61.They said, "We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] 
him, and indeed, we will do [it]."
62.And [Joseph] said to his servants, "Put their merchandise555
into their saddl ebags so they might recognize it when they have 
gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return."
63.So when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father, 
[further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our 
brother [tha t] we will be given measure.  And indeed, we will 
be his guardians."
64.He said, "Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion]
as I entrusted you with his brother before?  But AllŒh is the 
best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the mercifu l."
                                               
553Due to the change in his appearance over the years.554i.e., Benjamin, who had been kept at home by his father Jacob.555The goods which they had brought to trade for food supplies.

Page 244:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
22265.And when they opened their baggage, they found their 
merchandise returned to them.  They said, "O our father, what 
[more] could we desire?  This is our merchandise returned to 
us.  And we will obtain supplies [i.e., food] for our family and 
protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; 
that is an easy measurement."556
66.[Jacob] said, "Never will I send him with you until you give 
me a promise [i.e., oath] by AllŒh that you will bring him 
[back] to me, unless you should be surrounded [i.e., overcome 
by enemies]."  And when they had given their promise, he said,
"AllŒh, over what we say, is Witness."
67.And he said, "O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter 
from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the 
decree of] AllŒh at all.  The decision is only for AllŒh; upon 
Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely 
[indeed] rely."
68.And when they entered from where their father had ordered them,
it did not avail them against All Œh at all except [it was] a need 
[i.e., concern] within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied.  
And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what 
We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.
69.And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to 
himself; he said , "Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair 
over what they used to do [to me]."
70.So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the 
[gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother.  Then an 
announcer called out, "O caravan, indeed you a re thieves."
71.They said while approaching them, "What is it you are missing?"
72.They said, "We are missing the measure of the king.  And for 
he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am 
responsible for it."
                                               
556For them.  Or one obtained by us with ease.

Page 245:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
22373.They said, "By All Œh, you have certainly known that we did not 
come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been
thieves."
74.They [the accusers] said, "Then what would be its recompense557
if you should be liars?"
75.[The brothers] said, "Its recompense is that he in whose bag it 
is found –he [himself] will be its recompense.558  Thus do we 
recompense the wrongdoers."
76.So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his 
brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother.  Thus 
did We plan for Joseph .  He could not have taken his brother 
within the religion [i.e., law] of the king except that AllŒh willed.   
We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor 
of knowledge is one [more] knowing.559
77.They said, "If he steals –a brother of his has stolen before."  
But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them .560  
He said, "You are worse in position, and All Œh is most knowing
of what you describe."
78.They said, "O ÔAzeez,561indeed he has a father [who is] an old 
man, so take one o f us in place of him.  Indeed, we see you as 
a doer of good."
79.He said, "[I seek] the refuge of All Œh [to prevent] that we take 
except him with whom we found our possession.  Indeed, we 
would then be unjust."
80.So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves 
in private consultation.  The eldest of them said, "Do you not 
know that your father has taken upon you an oath by AllŒh 
and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph?  So I 
                                               
557The p unishment for theft.558According to their law, a convicted thief was made a slave of the one 
from whom he had stolen.559Ending with the ultimate knowledge of All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ).560He did not answer that he himself had been stolen by them from his fat her.561Addressing Joseph, who now held the title of "al -ÔAzeez."

S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
224will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or 
AllŒh decides for me,562and He is the best of judges.
81.Return to your father and say, 'O our father, indeed your son 
has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew.  
And we were not witnesses of the unseen.563
82.And ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which 
we came –and indeed, we are truthful. '"
83.[Jacob] said, "Rather, your souls have enticed you to something,
so patience is most fitting.  Perhaps AllŒh will bring them to 
me all together.  Indeed, it is He who is the Know ing, the Wise."
84.And he turned away from them and said, "Oh, my sorrow over 
Joseph," and his eyes became white564from grief, for he was 
[of that] a suppressor.565
85.They said, "By All Œh, you will not cease remembering Joseph 
until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish."
86.He said, "I only complain of my suffering and my grief to 
AllŒh, and I know from All Œh that which you do not know.
87.O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and 
despair not of relief from AllŒh.  Indeed , no one despairs of 
relief from All Œh except the disbelieving people."
88.So when they entered upon him [i.e., Joseph], they said, "O 
ÔAzeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have 
come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure a nd 
be charitable to us.  Indeed, All Œh rewards the charitable."
89.He said, "Do you know what you did with Joseph and his 
brother when you were ignorant?"
90.They said, "Are you indeed Joseph?"  He said, "I am Joseph, 
and this is my brother.  All Œh has c ertainly favored us.  Indeed,
                                               
562i.e., in my favor by bringing about the release of Benjamin.563i.e., We could not have known when we gave you the oath that he would 
steal and be apprehended.564i.e., he lost his sight.565He did not express the extent of his grief or his anger at what he suspected
his sons had done but was patient, depending only upon All Œh for help.

S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
225he who fears All Œh and is patient, then indeed, All Œh does not 
allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."
91.They said, "By All Œh, certainly has All Œh preferred you over us,
and indeed, we have been sinners."
92.Hesaid, "No blame will there be upon you today.  All Œh will 
forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful.
93.Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he 
will become seeing.  And bring me your family, all together."
94.And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said,566
"Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was 
alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind."
95.They said, "By All Œh, indeed you are in your [same] old error."
96.And when the bearer of good tidings567arrived, he cast it over 
his face, and he returned [once again] seeing.  He said, "Did I not 
tell you that I know from All Œh that which you do not know?"
97.They said, "O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; 
indeed , we have been sinners."
98.He said, "I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord.  Indeed,
it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
99.And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to 
himself [i.e., embraced them] and said, "Enter Egypt, AllŒh 
willing, safe [and secure]."
100.And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to 
him in prostration.568  And he said, "O my father, this is the 
explanation of my vision of before.  My Lord has made it 
reality.  And He was certainly good to me when He took me out
of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan 
had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers.  
                                               
566To those present with him, either some of his sons or other relatives.567He who carried Joseph's shirt from among the brothers.568That of greeting and respect, which was lawful until the time of Prophet 
Muúammad ().  Prostration to any person or object other than AllŒh 
was then prohibited conclusively.

Page 248:
S´rah 12–Y´suf JuzÕ 13
226Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills.  Indeed, it is He 
who is the Knowing, the Wise.
101.My Lord, You h ave given me [something] of sovereignty and 
taught me of the interpretation of dreams.  Creator of the heavens 
and earth, You are my protector in this world and the Hereafter.   
Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."
102.That is from thenews of the unseen which We reveal, [O 
Muúammad ], to you.  And you were not with them when they 
put together their plan while they conspired.
103.And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not 
believers.
104.And you do not ask of them forit any payment.  It is not 
except a reminder to the worlds.
105.And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they 
pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away.
106.And most of them believe not in AllŒh except while they 
associate others with Him.
107.Then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an 
overwhelming [aspect] of the punishment of All Œh or that the 
Hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not 
perceive?
108.Say, "This is my way; I invite to AllŒh with insight , I and 
those who follow me.  And exalted is All Œh; and I am not of 
those who associate others with Him."
109.And We sent not before you [as messengers] except men to 
whom We revealed from among the people of cities.  So have 
they569not traveled through the earth and observed how was 
the end of those before them?  And the home of the Hereafter 
is best for those who fear All Œh; then will you not reason?
110.[They continued] until, when the messengers despaired and 
were certain that they had been denied, there came to them 
                                               
569Those who deny Prophet Muúammad ( ).

227Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved.  And Our 
punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are 
criminals.
111.There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of 
understanding.  Never was it [i.e., the QurÕŒn] a narrat ion 
invented, but a confirmation of what was before it and a 
detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for 
a people who believe.

1.Alif, LŒm, Meem, RŒ.571  These are the verses of the Book; and 
what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but 
most of the people do not believe.
2.It is All Œh who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can]
see; then He established Himself above the Throne and made 
subject572the sun and the moon, e ach running [its course] for a 
specified term.  He arranges [each] matter; He details the signs 
that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain.
3.And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set 
mountains and rivers; and from all o f the fruits He made therein 
two mates; He causes the night to cover the day.  Indeed in that 
are signs for a people who give thought.
4.And within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of 
grapevines and crops and palm trees, [growing] several from a
root or otherwise,573watered with one water; but We make some
of them exceed others in [quality of] fruit.  Indeed in that are 
signs for a people who reason.
5.And if you are astonished,574[O Muúammad ] –then astonishing 
is their saying, "When we are dust, will we indeed be [brought] into 
a new creation?"  Those are the ones who have disbelieved in their
Lord, and those will have shackles575upon their necks, and those
are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.
6.They impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good,576
                                               
570Ar-RaÔd:  Thunder.571See footnote to 2:1.572For the benefit of mankind.573i.e., only one from a root.574At those who deny resurre ction.575Iron collars to which their hands are chained.576They said, challenging the Prophet ( ) in ridicule, "Bring on the punishment,
if you are truthful," rather than asking for mercy and forgiveness from All Œh.

Page 251:
S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
229while there has already occurred before them similar punishments
[to what they demand].  And indeed, your Lord is full of 
forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing, and indeed,
your Lord is severe in pena lty.
7.And those who disbelieved say, "Why has a sign not been sent 
down to him from his Lord?"  You are only a warner, and for 
every people is a guide.
8.AllŒh knows what every female carries577and what the wombs 
lose [prematurely] or exceed.578  And everything with Him is 
by due measure.
9.[He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, 
the Exalted.
10.It is the same [to Him] concerning you whether one conceals 
[his] speech or one publicizes it and whether one is hidden by 
night or conspicu ous [among others] by day.
11.For him [i.e., each one] are successive [angels]579before and 
behind him who protect him by the decree of AllŒh.580  
Indeed, AllŒh will not change the condition of a people until 
they change what is in themselves.  And when AllŒh intends 
for a people ill,581there is no repelling it.  And there is not for 
them besides Him any patron.
12.It is He who shows you lightening, [causing] fear and aspiration,
and generates the heavy clouds.
13.And the thunder exalts [AllŒh] with praise of Him –and the 
angels [as well] from fear of Him –and He sends thunderbolts 
and strikes therewith whom He wills while they dispute about 
AllŒh; and He is severe in assault.
                                               
577With absolute knowledge inclusive of every aspect of the fetus' existence.578Beyond their normal period of pregnancy and/or the number of fetuses therein.579Replacing each other by turn.580The phrase may also be rendered "...who guard him from [everything except]
the decree of All Œh."581i.e., punishme nt or destruction because of their sins.

Page 252:
S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
23014.To Him [alone] is the supplication of truth.  And those they 
call upon beside s Him do not respond to them with a thing, 
except as one who stretches his hands toward water [from afar,
calling it] to reach his mouth, but it will not reach it [thus].582  
And the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error 
[i.e., futility].
15.And to All Œh prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the 
earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows [as well] 
in the mornings and the afternoons.
16.Say, "Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?"  Say, "AllŒh."  
Say, "Have you then taken besides Him allies not possessing 
[even] for themselves any benefit or any harm?"  Say, "Is the 
blind equivalent to the seeing?  Or is darkness equivalent to 
light?  Or have they attributed to AllŒh partners who created 
like His creation so that the creation [ of each] seemed similar 
to them?"583  Say, "All Œh is the Creator of all things, and He is 
the One, the Prevailing."
17.He sends down from the sky, rain, and valleys flow according 
to their capacity, and the torrent carries a rising foam.  And from
that [ore ] which they heat in the fire, desiring adornments and 
utensils, is a foam like it.  Thus AllŒh presents [the example 
of] truth and falsehood.  As for the foam, it vanishes, [being] 
cast off; but as for that which benefits the people, it remains 
on the ear th.  Thus does All Œh present examples.
18.For those who have responded to their Lord is the best [reward], 
but those who did not respond to Him –if they had all that is 
in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would 
[attempt to] ransom them selves thereby.  Those will have the 
worst account, and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the 
resting place.
19.Then is he who knows that what has been revealed to you 
from your Lord is the truth like one who is blind?  They will 
only be reminded who are people of understanding –
                                               
582The analogy indicates that false deities will never respond to them at all.583The obvious conclusion is that the claimed partners, having no ability to create,
cannot be compared to All Œh in any way.

S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
23120.Those who fulfill the covenant of AllŒh and do not break the 
contract,
21.And those who join that which All Œh has ordered to be joined584
and fear their Lord and are afraid of the evil of [their] account,
22.And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord,
and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided 
for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good –
those will have the good consequence of [this] home585–
23.Gardens of perpetual reside nce; they will enter them with 
whoever were righteous among their fathers, their spouses and 
their descendants.  And the angels will enter upon them from 
every gate, [saying],
24."Peace [i.e., security] be upon you for what you patiently 
endured.  And exc ellent is the final home."
25.But those who break the covenant of All Œh after contracting it 
and sever that which AllŒh has ordered to be joined and 
spread corruption on earth –for them is the curse, and they 
will have the worst home.586
26.AllŒh extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it].  
And they rejoice in the worldly life, while the worldly life is 
not, compared to the Hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment.
27.And those who disbelieved say, "Why has a sign not been sent 
down to him from his Lord?"  Say, [O Muúammad ], "Indeed, 
AllŒh leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself 
whoever turns back [to Him] –
28.Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the 
remembrance of All Œh.  Unquestionably, by the remembrance 
of All Œh hearts are assured."
                                               
584i.e., they uph old the ties of relationship.585i.e., the world and its trials, its good consequence being Paradise.586i.e., Hell.  Another meaning is (in contrast to verse 22), "...and they will 
have the bad consequence of [this] home," also referring to Hell.

Page 254:
S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
23229.Those who have believed and done righteous deeds –a good 
state is theirs and a good return.
30.Thus have We sent you to a community before which [other] 
communities have passed on so you might recite to them that 
which We revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most 
Merciful.  Say, "He is my Lord; there is no deity except Him.  
Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return."
31.And if there was any qurÕŒn [i.e., recitation] by which the 
mountains would be removed or the earth woul d be broken 
apart or the dead would be made to speak,587[it would be this 
QurÕŒn], but to AllŒh belongs the affair entirely.  Then have 
those who believed not accepted that had AllŒh willed, He 
would have guided the people, all of them?  And those who 
disbe lieve do not cease to be struck, for what they have done, 
by calamity –or it will descend near their home –until there 
comes the promise of AllŒh.  Indeed, AllŒh does not fail in 
[His] promise.
32.And already were [other] messengers ridiculed before you, 
and I extended the time of those who disbelieved; then I 
seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.
33.Then is He who is a maintainer of every soul, [knowing] what 
it has earned, [like any other]?  But to All Œh they have attributed
partners.  Say, "Name them.  Or do you inform Him of that588
which He knows not upon the earth or of what is appar ent 
[i.e., alleged] of speech?"589  Rather, their [own] plan has been 
made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been 
averted from the way.  And whome ver AllŒh leaves astray –
there will be for him no guide.
34.For them will be punishment in the life of [this] world, and the 
punishment of the Hereafter is more severe.  And they will not 
have from All Œh any protector.
                                               
587As suggeste d by the disbelievers.588i.e., other "deities."589i.e., your attributing of divinity to other than All Œh.

Page 255:
S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
23335.The example [i.e., description] of Paradise, which the righteous
have been promised, is [that] beneath it rivers flow.  Its fruit is 
lasting, and its shade.  That is the consequence for the righteous,
and the consequence for the disbelievers is the Fire.
36.And [the believers among] th ose to whom We have given the 
[previous] Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you, 
[O Muúammad ], but among the [opposing] factions are those 
who deny part of it [i.e., the QurÕŒn].  Say, "I have only been 
commanded to worship AllŒh and not associ ate [anything] 
with Him.  To Him I invite, and to Him is my return."
37.And thus We have revealed it as an Arabic legislation.590  And 
if you should follow their inclinations after what has come to 
you of knowledge, you would not have against All Œh any ally
or any protector.
38.And We have already sent messengers before you and assigned
to them wives and descendants.  And it was not for a messenger
to come with a sign except by permission of All Œh.  For every 
term is a decree.
39.AllŒh eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is 
the Mother of the Book.591
40.And whether We show you part of what We promise them or 
take you in death, upon you is only the [duty of] notification, 
and upon Us is the account.
41.Have they not seen that We set upon the l and, reducing it from 
its borders?592  And AllŒh decides; there is no adjuster of His 
decision.  And He is swift in account.
42.And those before them had plotted, but to AllŒh belongs the plan
entirely.  He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers
will know for whom is the final home.
                                               
590i.e., revealed in the Arabic language.591The Preserved Slate (al-Lawú al-Maúf´ th), in which is inscribed the 
original of every scripture revealed by All Œh.592Referring to the spread of IslŒm through AllŒh's Prophet () and the 
diminishing of those areas controlled by the polytheists.

S´rah 13–ar-RaÔd JuzÕ 13
23443.And those who have disbelieved say, "You are not a messenger."   
Say, [O Muúammad ], "Sufficient is All Œh as Witness between 
me and you, and [the witness of] whoever has knowledge of 
the Scripture."593
                                               
593i.e., those who recognize the truth through their knowledge of previous 
scriptures.

1.Alif, LŒm, RŒ.595  [This is] a Book which We have revealed to 
you, [O Muúammad ], that you might bring mankind out of 
darknesses into the light by permission of their Lord –to the 
path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy –
2.AllŒh, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever 
is on the earth.  And woe [i.e., destruction] to the disbelievers 
from a severe punishment –
3.The ones who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter and 
avert [people] from the way of AllŒh, seeking to make it [seem] 
deviant.  Those are in extreme error.
4.And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the 
language of his people to state clearly for them, and All Œh sends 
astray [thereby] whom He wills596and guides whom He wills.   
And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
5.And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], "Bring 
out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them 
of the days597of AllŒh."  Indeed in that are signs for everyone 
patient and grateful.
6.And [recall, O Children of Israel], when Moses said to his people,
"Remember the favor of All Œh upon you when He saved you from
the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst
torment and were slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping
your females alive.  And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
7.And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful,
I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, 
My punishment is severe. '"

2368.And Moses said, "If you shou ld disbelieve, you and whoever 
is on the earth entirely –indeed, AllŒh is Free of need and 
Praiseworthy."
9.Has there not reached you the news of those before you –the 
people of Noah and ÔAad and Tham´d and those after them?  
No one knows them [i.e., their number] but AllŒh.  Their 
messengers brought them clear proofs, but they returned their 
hands to their mouths598and said, "Indeed, we disbelieve in 
that with which you have been sent, and indeed we are, about 
that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt."
10.Their messengers said, "Can there be doubt about AllŒh, 
Creator of the heavens and earth?  He invites you that He may 
forgive you of your sins, and He delays you [i.e., your death] 
for a specified term."  They said, "You are not but men like u s 
who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping.  
So bring us a clear authority [i.e., evidence]."
11.Their messengers said to them, "We are only men like you, 
but AllŒh confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants.  
It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by 
permission of All Œh.  And upon All Œh let the believers rely.
12.And why should we not rely upon All Œh while He has guided 
us to our [good] ways.  And we will surely be patient against 
whatever harm you should cause us.   And upon All Œh let those 
who would rely [indeed] rely."
13.And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, "We will 
surely drive you out of our land, or you must return to our 
religion."  So their Lord inspired to them, "We will surely 
destroy the w rongdoers.
14.And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them.  
That is for he who fears My position599and fears My threat."
                                               
598Several explanations have been given as to the meaning.  Based upon the 
conclusion of the verse, Ibn Katheer preferred that this was a gesture of 
denial and rejection.599An alternative meaning is "the standing [for account] before Me."

23715.And they requested decision [i.e., victory from AllŒh], and 
disappointed, [therefore], was every obstinate tyrant.
16.Before him600is Hell, and he will be given a drink of purulent 
water.601
17.He will gulp it but will hardly [be able to] swallow it.  And 
death will come to him from everywhere, but he is not to die.  
And before him is a massive punishment.
18.The exam ple of those who disbelieve in their Lord is [that] 
their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on 
a stormy day; they are unable [to keep] from what they earned 
a [single] thing.  That is what is extreme error.
19.Have you not seen [i.e., considered] that AllŒh created the 
heavens and the earth in truth?  If He wills, He can do away 
with you and produce a new creation.
20.And that is not difficult for All Œh.
21.And they will come out [for judgement] before AllŒh all 
together, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, 
"Indeed, we were your followers, so can you avail us anything 
against the punishment of AllŒh?"  They will say, "If AllŒh 
had guided us, we would have guided you.  It is all the same 
for us whether we show intolerance o r are patient:  there is for 
us no place of escape."
22.And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, 
"Indeed, AllŒh had promised you the promise of truth.  And I 
promised you, but I betrayed you.  But I had no authority over 
you except that I in vited you, and you responded to me.  So do 
not blame me; but blame yourselves.  I cannot be called to 
your aid, nor can you be called to my aid.  Indeed, I deny your 
association of me [with AllŒh] before.602  Indeed, for the 
wrongdoers is a painful punishmen t."

23823.And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted
to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein 
by permission of their Lord; and their greeting therein will be, 
"Peace!"
24.Have you not considered how AllŒh presents an example, 
[making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly 
fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?
25.It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord.  
And All Œh presents examples for the people that perhaps they 
will be remi nded.
26.And the example of a bad word is like a bad tree, uprooted 
from the surface of the earth, not having any stability.
27.AllŒh keeps firm those who believe, with the firm word,603in 
worldly life and in the Hereafter.604  And AllŒh sends astray 
the wr ongdoers.  And All Œh does what He wills.
28.Have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of 
AllŒh for disbelief605and settled their people [in] the home of 
ruin?
29.[It is] Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is 
the settlement.
30.And they have attributed to All Œh equals to mislead [people] from
His way.  Say, "Enjoy yourselves, for indeed, your destination

31.[O Muúammad ], tell My servants who have believed to 
establish prayer and spend from what We have provided t hem, 
secretly and publicly, before a Day comes in which there will 
be no exchange [i.e., ransom], nor any friendships.
32.It is AllŒh who created the heavens and the earth and sent 
down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as 
                                               
603The testimony that there is no deity except All Œh and that Muúammad () 
is the messenger of All Œh.604When questioned in their graves by the angels after death.605They met All Œh's blessing with denial instead of gratitude.

239provision for you and subjected for you606the ships to sail 
through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers.
33.And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous 
[in orbit], and subjected for you the night and the day.
34.And He gave you from allyou asked of Him.607  And if you 
should count the favor [i.e., blessings] of All Œh, you could not 
enumerate them.  Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust 
and ungrateful.608
35.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Abraham said, "My Lord,
make this city [i.e., Makkah] secure and keep me and my sons 
away from worshipping idols.
36.My Lord, indeed they have led astray many among the people.  
So whoever follows me –then he is of me;609and whoever 
disobeys me –indeed, You are [yet] Forgiving and Merciful.
37.Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an 
uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that 
they may establish prayer.  So make hearts among the people 
incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that 
they might be grateful.
38.Our Lord, indeed You know what we conceal and what we 
declare, and nothing is hidden from AllŒh on the earth or in 
the heaven.
39.Praise to All Œh, who has granted to me in old age Ishmael and 
Isaac.  Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication.
40.My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and [many] from 
my descendants.  Our Lord, and accept my supplication.
41.Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers the 
Day the account is established."
                                               
606i.e., made serviceable to you.607Something of what you asked and all of what you continually require, 
according to His wisdom.608i.e., disbelieving and denying of All Œh's favor.609i.e., of my religion.

24042.And never think that All Œh is unaware of wha t the wrongdoers 
do.  He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when 
eyes will stare [in horror].
43.Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come
back to them,610and their hearts are void.
44.And, [O Muúammad ], warn the people of a Day when the 
punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will 
say, "Our Lord, delay us for a short term; we will answer 
Your call and follow the messengers."  [But it will be said], 
"Had you not sworn, before, that for you there would be no 
cessation?611
45.And you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged 
themselves, and it had become clear to you how We dealt with 
them.  And We presented for you [many] examples."
46.And they had planned their plan, but with All Œh is [recorded] 
their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away 
with the mountains.612
47.So never think that AllŒh will fail in His promise to His 
messengers.  Indeed, All Œh is Exalted in Might and Owner of 
Retribution.
48.[It will be] on the Day the earth will be replaced by another 
earth, and the heavens [as well], and they [i.e., all creatures] 
will come out before All Œh, the One, the Prevailing,
49.And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in 
shackles,
50.Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire
51.So that AllŒh will recompense every soul for what it earned.  
Indeed, All Œh is swift in account .
                                               
610This is their state at the time of resurrection from the graves.  Their heads 
are upraised in fixed stares of terror, unable even to glance back.611Of the blessings which All Œh had bestowed upon you during life on earth.612An alternative meaning is "...and their plan was not [sufficient] to do 
away with the mountains," i.e., it had no effect against All Œh's will.

6.And they say, "O you upon whom the message has been sent 
down, indeed you are mad.616
7.Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among 
the truthful?"
8.We do not send down the angels except with truth;617and they 
[i.e., the disbelievers] would not then be reprieved.
9.Indeed, it is We who sent down the message [i.e., the QurÕ Œn], 
and indeed, We will be its guardian.
10.And We had certainly sent [messengers] before you, [O 
Muúammad ], among the sects of the former peoples.
11.And no messenger would come to them except that they 
ridiculed him.
12.Thus do We insert it [i.e., denial] into the hearts of the criminals.

they continued therein to ascend,

we are a people affected by magic."
16.And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have

burning flame.
19.And the earth –We have spread it and cast therein firmly set 
mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every

26.And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered 
black mud.
27.And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.
28.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when your Lord said to the angels,
"I will create a human being out of clay from an altered black 
mud.
29.And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of 
My [created] soul,621then fall down to him in prostration."
30.So the angels prostrated –all of them entirely,
31.Except Iblees;622he refused to be with those who prostrated.
32.[AllŒh] said, "O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you th at you 
are not with those who prostrate?"
33.He said, "Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created
out of clay from an altered black mud."
34.[AllŒh] said, "Then depart from it,623for indeed, you are expelled.
35.And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Recompense."
36.He said, "My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are 
resurrected."
37.[AllŒh] said, "So indeed, you are of those reprieved
38.Until the Day of the time well -known."
39.[Iblees] said, "My Lord, because You have pu t me in error, I will
surely make [disobedience] attractive to them [i.e., mankind] 
on earth, and I will mislead them all
40.Except, among them, Your chosen servants."
41.[AllŒh] said, "This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.

except those who follow you of the deviators.
43.And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.
44.It has seven gates; for every gate is of them [i.e., Satan's followers]

Forgiving, the Merciful,

51.And inform them about the gu ests of Abraham,
52.When they entered upon him and said, "Peace."  [Abraham] 
said, "Indeed, we are fearful [i.e., apprehensive] of you."
53.[The angels] said, "Fear not.  Indeed, we give you good tidings
of a learned boy."
54.He said, "Have you given megood tidings although old age 
has come upon me?  Then of what [wonder] do you inform?"
55.They said, "We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not
be of the despairing."
56.He said, "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except 
for those astra y?"
57.[Abraham] said, "Then what is your business [here], O 
messengers?"
58.They said, "Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,
59.Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all

24660.Except his wife."  We [i.e., All Œh] decreed that she is of those 
who remain behind.625
61.And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,
62.He said, "Indeed, you are people unknown."
63.They said, "But we have come to you with that about which 
they were disputing,
64.And we have come to you with tr uth, and indeed, we are truthful.
65.So set out with your family during a portion of the night and 
follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back 
and continue on to where you are commanded."
66.And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matte r:  that 
those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.
67.And the people of the city came rejoicing.626
68.[Lot] said, "Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.
69.And fear All Œh and do not disgrace me."
70.They said, "Have we not forbidd en you from [protecting] 
people?"
71.[Lot] said, "These are my daughters627–if you would be doers 
[of lawful marriage]."
72.By your life, [O Muúammad ], indeed they were, in their 
intoxication, wandering blindly.
73.So the shriek628seized them at sunrise.
74.And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and 
rained upon them stones of hard clay.
75.Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.
76.And indeed, they [i.e., those cities] are [situated] on an established
road.
                                               
625For having collaborated with the evildoers.626At the news of Lot's visitors.627i.e., the women of his community who were lawful for marriage.628See footnote to 11:67 .

24777.Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.
78.And the companions of the thicket [i.e., the people of Madyan]
were [also] wrongdoers,
79.So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] 
are on a clear highway.
80.And certainly did the companions of al-îijr629[i.e., the Tham´d]
deny the messengers.
81.And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning
away.
82.And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling 
secure.
83.But the shriek seized them at early morning,
84.So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.
85.And We have not created the heavens and earth and that
between them except in truth.  And indeed, the Hour is coming;
so forgive with gracious forgiveness.
86.Indeed, your Lord –He is the Knowing Creator.
87.And We have certainly given you, [O Muúammad ], seven of 
the often repeated [verses]630and the great QurÕ Œn.
88.Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given 
enjoyment to [certain] categories of them [i.e., the disbelievers],
and do not grieve over them.   And lower your wing [i.e., show 
kindness] to the believers
89.And say, "Indeed, I am the clear warner" –
90.Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators631
91.Who have made the QurÕ Œn into portions.632

24892.So by your Lord, We will surely questio n them all
93.About what they used to do.
94.Then declare what you are commanded633and turn away from 
the polytheists.634
95.Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers
96.Who make [equal] with AllŒh another deity.  But they are 
going to know.
97.And We already know that your breast is constrained by what 
they say.
98.So exalt [All Œh] with praise of your Lord and be of those who 
prostrate [to Him].
99.And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty 
[i.e., death].
                                               
633The implication is "Thereby you will distinguish or separate the disbelievers
from the believers."634Any who persist in association of others with All Œh.

1.The command of AllŒh is coming,636so be not impatient for it.  
Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.
2.He sends down the angels, with the inspiration [i.e., revelation] 
of His command, upon whom He wills o f His servants, [telling 
them], "Warn that there is no deity except Me; so fear Me."
3.He created the heavens and earth in truth.  High is He above 
what they associate with Him.
4.He created man from a sperm -drop; then at once637he is a clear 
adversary.
5.And the grazing livestock He has created for you; in them is 
warmth638and [numerous] benefits, and from them you eat.
6.And for you in them is [the enjoyment of] beauty when you 
bring them in [for the evening] and when you send them out [to 
pasture].
7.And they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached 
except with difficulty to yourselves.  Indeed, your Lord is Kind 
and Merciful.
8.And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride 
and [as] adornment.  And He creates that which you do not 
know.
9.And upon All Œh639is the direction of the [right] way, and among 
them [i.e., the various paths] are those deviating.  And if He willed,
He could have guided you all.

25010.It is He who sends down rain from the sky; from it is drink 
and from it is foliage in which you pasture [animals].
11.He causes to grow for you thereby the crops, olives, palm trees,
grapevines, and from all the fruits.  Indeed in that is a sign for 
a people who give thought.
12.And He has subjected for you the night and day and the sun 
and moon, and the stars are subjected by His command.  Indeed 
in that are signs for a people who reason.
13.And [He has subjected] whatever He multiplied for you on the 
earth of varying colors.  Indeed in that is a sign for a people 
who re member.
14.And it is He who subjected the sea for you to eat from it 
tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear.  
And you see the ships plowing through it, and [He subjected it]
that you may seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be gra teful.
15.And He has cast into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift
with you, and [made] rivers and roads, that you may be guided,
16.And landmarks.  And by the stars they are [also] guided.640
17.Then is He who creates like one who does not crea te?  So will 
you not be reminded?
18.And if you should count the favors of AllŒh, you could not 
enumerate them.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
19.And All Œh knows what you conceal and what you declare.
20.And those they invoke other than AllŒhcreate nothing, and 
they [themselves] are created.
21.They are, [in fact], dead,641not alive, and they do not perceive 
when they will be resurrected.
22.Your god is one God.  But those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter –their hearts are disapproving, and they are arrogant.
                                               
640Through the desert or the sea at night.641i.e., inanimate or without understanding.

Page 273:
S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25123.Assuredly, All Œh knows what they conceal and what they declare.   
Indeed, He does not like the arrogant.
24.And when it is said to them, "What has your Lord sent down?"
they say, "Legends of the former peoples,"
25.That they may bear their own burdens [i.e., sins] in full on the 
Day of Resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they
misguide without [i.e., by lack of] knowledge.  Unquestionably,
evil is that which they bear.
26.Those before them had already plotted, but AllŒh came at [i.e., 
uprooted] their building from the foundations, so the roof fell 
upon them from above them,642and the punishment came to 
them from where they did not perceive.
27.Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and 
say, "Where areMy 'partners' for whom you used to oppose 
[the believers]?"  Those who were given knowledge will say, 
"Indeed disgrace, this Day, and evil are upon the disbelievers" –
28.The ones whom the angels take in death [while] wronging 
themselves,643and [who] then offer submission, [saying], "We 
were not doing any evil."  But, yes!  Indeed, All Œh is Knowing 
of what you used to do.
29.So enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and how 
wretched is the residence of the arrogant.
30.And it will be said to those who feared All Œh, "What did your 
Lord send down?"  They will say, "[That which is] good."  
For those who do good in this world is good; and the home of 
the Hereafter is better.  And how excellent is the home of the 
righteous –
31.Gardens of perpetu al residence, which they will enter, beneath
which rivers flow.  They will have therein whatever they wish.  
Thus does All Œh reward the righteous –
                                               
642i.e., All Œh caused their plan to fail and exposed their plot.643i.e., having made punishment due to them for their numerous sins and crimes.

S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25232.The ones whom the angels take in death, [being] good and pure;
[the angels] will say, "Peace be upon you .  Enter Paradise for 
what you used to do."
33.Do they [i.e., the disbelievers] await except that the angels should 
come to them or there comes the command of your Lord?  
Thus did those do before them.  And All Œh wronged them not, 
but they had been wrongi ng themselves.
34.So they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did 
and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
35.And those who associate others with AllŒh say, "If AllŒh had 
willed, we would not have worshipped anything other than Him ,
neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything
through other than Him."  Thus did those do before them.  So is
there upon the messengers except [the duty of] clear notification?
36.And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [ saying], 
"Worship AllŒh and avoid ‹Œgh´t ."644  And among them were 
those whom AllŒh guided, and among them were those upon 
whom error was [deservedly] decreed.  So proceed [i.e., travel]
through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.
37.[Even ] if you should strive for their guidance, [O Muúammad ],
indeed, AllŒh does not guide those He sends astray,645and 
they will have no helpers.
38.And they swear by All Œh their strongest oaths [that] All Œh will 
not resurrect one who dies.  But yes –[it is] a true promise 
[binding] upon Him, but most of the people do not know.
39.[It is] so He will make clear to them [the truth of] that wherein 
they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that 
they were liars.
40.Indeed, Our word to a thing when W e intend it is but that We 
say to it, "Be," and it is.
                                               
644False objects of worship.645As a result of their choice to reject guidance.

S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25341.And those who emigrated for [the cause of] AllŒh after they 
had been wronged –We will surely settle them in this world 
in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if 
only they cou ld know.
42.[They are] those who endured patiently and upon their Lord relied.
43.And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed
[Our message].  So ask the people of the message [i.e., former 
scriptures] if you do not know.
44.[We sent them] with clear proofs and written ordinances.  And 
We revealed to you the message [i.e., the QurÕŒn] that you 
may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and 
that they might give thought.
45.Then, do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure t hat All Œh 
will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment
will not come upon them from where they do not perceive?
46.Or that He would not seize them during their [usual] activity, 
and they could not cause failure [i.e., escape from Him]?
47.Or that He would not seize them gradually [in a state of dread]?646  
But indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.647
48.Have they not considered what things AllŒh has created?  
Their shadows incline to the right and to the left, prostrating 
to All Œh, while they [i.e., those creations] are humble.
49.And to All Œh prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever
is on the earth of creatures, and the angels [as well], and they 
are not arrogant.
50.They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are 
commanded.
51.And All Œh has said, "Do not take for yourselves two648deities.  
He [i.e., All Œh] is but one God, so fear only Me."
                                               
646i.e., being aware of what is about to strike them after ha ving seen those 
near them succumb.647Postponing deserved punishment and giving opportunities for repentance.648Meaning more than one.

25452.And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, 
and to Him is [due] worship constantly.  Then is it other than
AllŒh that you fear?
53.And whatever you have of favor –it is from All Œh.  Then when
adversity touches you, to Him you cry for help.
54.Then when He removes the adversity from you, at once a party
of you associates others with their Lord
55.So they will deny what We have given them.  Then enjoy 
yourselves, for you are going to know.
56.And they assign to what they do not know649[i.e., false deities]
a portion of that which We have provided them.  By AllŒh, 
you will surely be questioned about what you u sed to invent.
57.And they attribute to All Œh daughters650–exalted is He –and 
for them is what they desire [i.e., sons].
58.And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, 
his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.
59.He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he 
has been informed.  Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it
in the ground?  Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.
60.For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is the description
[i.e., an attribu te] of evil;651and for All Œh is the highest attribute.   
And He is Exalted in Might, the Wise.
61.And if AllŒh were to impose blame on the people for their 
wrongdoing, He would not have left upon it [i.e., the earth] 
any creature, but He defers them for a specified term.  And 
when their term has come, they will not remain behind an 
hour, nor will they precede [it].
62.And they attribute to AllŒh that which they dislike [i.e., 
daughters], and their tongues assert the lie that they will have 
                                               
649i.e., that of which they have no knowledge; rather, they have mere assumption
based upon tradition or the claims of misguid ed men.650By claiming that the angels are His daughters.651Such as that described in the previous two verses.

S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
255the best [from Him].  Assuredly, they will have the Fire, and 
they will be [therein] neglected.652
63.By AllŒh, We did certainly send [messengers] to nations 
before you, but Satan made their deeds attractive to them.  
And he is their [i.e., the disbelievers] ally today [as well], and 
they will have a painful punishment.
64.And We have not revealed to you the Book, [O Muúammad ], 
except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have 
differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.
65.And AllŒh has sent down rain from the sky and given life 
thereby to the earth after its lifelessness.  Indeed in that is a 
sign for a people who listen.
66.And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson.  We give 
you drink from what is in their bellies –between excretion
and blood –pure milk, palatable to drinkers.
67.And from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take 
intoxicant and good provision.653  Indeed in that is a sign for a 
people who reason.
68.And your Lord inspired to the bee, "Take for yourself am ong 
the mountains, houses [i.e., hives], and among the trees and 
[in] that which they construct.
69.Then eat from all the fruits654and follow the ways of your 
Lord laid down [for you]."  There emerges from their bellies a 
drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people.  
Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.
70.And AllŒh created you; then He will take you in death.  And 
among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit [old] age
so that he will not know, after [having ha d] knowledge, a thing.   
Indeed, All Œh is Knowing and Competent.
                                               
652Another meaning is "...and they will be made to precede [all others thereto]."653This verse was revealed before the prohibition of intoxicants.  It alludes 
to the fact that there are both evil and good possibilities in certain things.654i.e., delicious substances found by the bee.

S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25671.And AllŒh has favored some of you over others in provision.  
But those who were favored [i.e., given more] would not hand 
over their provision to those whom their right hands possess 
[i.e., slaves] so they would be equal to them therein.655  Then 
is it the favor of All Œh they reject?
72.And AllŒh has made for you from yourselves mates and has 
made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has 
provided for you from the good things.  Then in falsehood do 
they believe and in the favor of All Œh they disbelieve?
73.And they worship besides AllŒh that which does not possess 
for them [the power of] provision from the heavens and the 
earth at all, and [in fact], they are unable.
74.So do n ot assert similarities to All Œh.656  Indeed, All Œh knows 
and you do not know.
75.AllŒh presents an example:  a slave [who is] owned and unable
to do a thing and he to whom We have provided from Us good 
provision, so he spends from it secretly and publicly. Can they
be equal?  Praise to All Œh!  But most of them do not know.
76.And All Œh presents an example of two men, one of them dumb
and unable to do a thing, while he is a burden to his guardian.  
Wherever he directs him, he brings no good.  Is he equal to
one who commands justice, while he is on a straight path?
77.And to All Œh belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and 
the earth.  And the command for the Hour is not but as a glance
of the eye or even nearer.  Indeed, AllŒh is over all things 
compete nt.
78.And All Œh has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers 
not knowing a thing, and He made for you hearing and vision 
and hearts [i.e., intellect] that perhaps you would be grateful.
                                               
655The argument presented in this verse is that if they cannot consider their 
own possessions equal to themselves, then how c an they consider All Œh's 
creations as being equal to Him?656As there is nothing comparable to Him.

Page 279:
S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25779.Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the 
sky?  None holds them up except AllŒh.  Indeed in that are 
signs for a people who believe.
80.And All Œh has made for you from your homes a place of rest 
and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which 
you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment;
and from their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment 
[i.e., provision] for a time.
81.And All Œh has made for you, from that which He has created, 
shadows [i.e., shade] and has made for you from the 
mountains, shelters and has made for you garments which 
protect you from the heat and garments [i.e., coats of mail] 
which protect you from your [enemy in] battle.  Thus does He 
complete His favor upon you that you might submit [to Him].
82.But if they turn away, [O Muúammad ] –then only upon you 
is [responsibility for] clear notification.
83.They recognize the favor of AllŒh; then they deny it.  And 
most of them are disbelievers.
84.And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect from every nation 
a witness [i.e., their prophet].   Then it will not be permitted to 
the disbelievers [to apologize or make excuses], nor will they 
be asked to appease [All Œh].
85.And when those who wronged see the punishment, it will not 
be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
86.And when those who associated others with AllŒh see their 
"partners," they will say, "Our Lord, these are our partners [to 
You] whom we used to invoke besides You."  But they will 
throw at them the statement, "Indeed, you are liars."
87.And they will impart to All Œhthat Day [their] submission, and 
lost from them is what they used to invent.
88.Those who disbelieved and averted [others] from the way of 
AllŒh –We will increase them in punishment over [their] 
punishment for what corruption they were causing.

Page 280:
S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25889.And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every
nation a witness over them from themselves [i.e., their prophet].   
And We will bring you, [O Muúammad ], as a witness over 
these [i.e., your nation].  And We have sent down to you the 
Book as clarificatio n for all things and as guidance and mercy 
and good tidings for the Muslims.657
90.Indeed, AllŒh orders justice and good conduct and giving to
relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression.   
He admonishes you that perhaps you will be remin ded.
91.And fulfill the covenant of AllŒh when you have taken it, [O
believers], and do not break oaths after their confirmation while 
you have made AllŒh, over you, a security [i.e., witness].   
Indeed, All Œh knows what you do.
92.And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it 
was strong [by] taking your oaths as [means of] deceit between
you because one community is more plentiful [in number or
wealth] than another community.658  AllŒh only tries you thereby.   
And He will surely make clear t o you on the Day of Resurrection
that over which you used to differ.
93.And if AllŒh had willed, He could have made you [of] one 
religion, but He causes to stray whom He wills and guides 
whom He wills.659  And you will surely be questioned about 
what you us ed to do.
94.And do not take your oaths as [means of] deceit between you, 
lest a foot slip after it was [once] firm, and you would taste 
evil [in this world] for what [people] you diverted from the 
way of All Œh,660and you would have [in the Hereafter] a gr eat 
punishment.
                                               
657Those who have submitted themselves to All Œh.658i.e., do not swear falsely or break a treaty or contract merely for a worldly 
advantage.659According to His kno wledge of each soul's preference.660Referring to those who would be dissuaded from IslŒm as a result of a 
Muslim's deceit and treachery.

S´rah 16–an-Naúl JuzÕ 14
25995.And do not exchange the covenant of All Œh for a small price.  
Indeed, what is with All Œh is best for you, if only you could know.
96.Whatever you have will end, but what AllŒh has is lasting.  
And We will surely give those who were patient their reward 
according to the best of what they used to do.
97.Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while 
he is a believer –We will surely cause him to live a good life, 
and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] 
according to the best of what they used to do.
98.Sowhen you recite theQurÕŒn, [first] seek refuge inAllŒh
from Satan, theexpelled [from His mercy].
99.Indeed, there is for him no authority over those who have 
believed and rely upon their Lord.
100.His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and 
those who through him associate others with All Œh.
101.And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse –and 
AllŒh is most knowing of what He sends down –they say, 
"You, [O Muúammad ], are but an inventor [of lies]."  But 
most of them do not know.
102.Say, [O Muúammad ], "The Pure Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] has
brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who 
believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims."
103.And We cer tainly know that they say, "It is only a human being
who teaches him [i.e., the Prophet ()]."  The tongue of the 
one they refer to is foreign,661and this [recitation, i.e., QurÕ Œn] 
is [in] a clear Arabic language.
104.Indeed, those who do not believe in the verses of AllŒh –
AllŒh will not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment.
105.They only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses 
of All Œh, and it is those who are the liars.
                                               
661Having seen the Prophet () speaking with a foreign man on occasion, 
the Quraysh accused him of repeating the man's words.

260106.Whoever disbelieves in [i.e., denies] All Œh after his b elief...662
except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while 
his heart is secure in faith.  But those who [willingly] open 
their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from AllŒh, and 
for them is a great punishment;
107.That is because they preferred the worldly life over the
Hereafter and that All Œh does not guide the disbelieving people.
108.Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision 
AllŒh has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless.
109.Assuredly, it is they, in the Hereafter, who will be the losers.
110.Then, indeed your Lord, to those who emigrated after they 
had been compelled [to say words of disbelief ] and thereafter 
fought [for the cause of All Œh] and were patient –indeed, your 
Lord, after that, is Forgiving a nd Merciful
111.On the Day when every soul will come disputing [i.e., pleading]
for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it 
did, and they will not be wronged [i.e., treated unjustly].
112.And AllŒh presents an example:  a city [i.e., Makkah] which 
was safe and secure, its provision coming to it in abundance 
from every location, but it denied the favors of All Œh.  So All Œh
made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what 
they had been doing.
113.And there had certainly come t o them a Messenger from among
themselves, but they denied him; so punishment overtook them
while they were wrongdoers.
114.Then eat of what All Œh has provided for you [which is] lawful 
and good.  And be grateful for the favor of All Œh, if it is [indeed]
Him that you worship.
115.He has only forbidden to you dead animals,663blood, the flesh 
of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All Œh.  
                                               
662Based upon the conclusion of this verse, the omitted phrase concerning 
the apostate is understood to be "...has earned the wrath of All Œh..."663Those not slau ghtered or hunted expressly for food.

261But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor 
transgressing [its limit] –then indeed , AllŒh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
116.And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, 
"This is lawful and this is unlawful," to invent falsehood about 
AllŒh.  Indeed, those who invent falsehood about AllŒh will 
not succeed.
117.[It is but] a brief enjoyment, and they will have a painful 
punishment.
118.And to those who are Jews We have prohibited that which We 
related to you before.664  And We did not wrong them [thereby],
but they were wronging themselves.
119.Then, indeed your Lord, to those who have done wrong out of
ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves –
indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
120.Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader,665devoutly 
obedient to AllŒh, inclining toward truth, and he was not of 
those who associate others with All Œh.
121.[He was] grateful for His favors.  He [i.e., AllŒh] chose him 
and guided him to a straight path.
122.And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the 
Hereafter he will be among the righteous.
123.Then We revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], to follow the 
religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of 
those who associate with All Œh.
124.The sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it.   
And indeed, your Lord will judge b etween them on the Day of 
Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
125.Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction,

262and argue with them in a way that is best.  Indeed, your Lord 
is most knowing of who has strayed fr om His way, and He is 
most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.
126.And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an 
equivalent of that with which you were harmed.666  But if you 
are patient –it is better for those who are patient.
127.And be patient, [O Muúammad ], and your patience is not but 
through All Œh.  And do not grieve over them and do not be in 
distress over what they conspire.
128.Indeed, AllŒh is with those who fear Him and those who are 
doers of good.

680For those who intend righteousness, hastening to repent from sins and 
errors committed through human weakness, All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) 
promises forgiveness.681i.e., on that which is unlawful or in disobedience to All Œh.682i.e., if you have not the means to give them at present.683i.e., refusing to spend.684i.e., being extravagant.685i.e., avoid all situations that might possibly lead to it.686i.e., through legal justi ce or during jihŒd.687Grounds for legal action.688i.e., to improve or increase it.

267commitment.  Indeed, the commitment is ever [that about which
one will be] questioned.
35.And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an 
even [i.e., honest] balance.  That is the best [way] and best in 
result.
36.And do not pursue689that of which you have no knowledge.  
Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart –about all those 
[one] will be questioned.
37.And do not walk upon the earth exultantly.  Indeed, you will 
never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the 
mountains in height.690
38.All that [i.e., the aforementioned] –its evil is ever, in the sight 
of your Lord, detested.
39.That is from what your Lord has revealed to you, [O Muúammad ],
of wisdom.  And, [O mankind], do not make [as equal] with 
AllŒh anot her deity, lest you be thrown into Hell, blamed and 
banished.
40.Then, has your Lord chosen you for [having] sons and taken 
[i.e., adopted] from among the angels daughters?  Indeed, you 
say a grave saying.
41.And We have certainly diversified [the conten ts] in this QurÕ Œn
that they [i.e., mankind] may be reminded, but it does not 
increase them [i.e., the disbelievers] except in aversion.
42.Say, [O Muúammad ], "If there had been with Him [other] 
gods, as they say, then they [each] would have sought to the
Owner of the Throne a way."691
43.Exalted is He and high above what they say by great sublimity.
44.The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt 
                                               
689i.e., do not assume and do not say.690Man, for all his arrogance, is yet a weak and small creature.691To please Him, recognizing His superiority.  Another interpretation is 
"...they would seek a way" to depose Him (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) and 
take over His Throne.

268Him.  And there is not a thing except that it exalts [All Œh] by 
His praise, but you do not un derstand their [way of] exalting.  
Indeed, He is ever Forbearing and Forgiving.
45.And when you recite the QurÕ Œn, We put between you and those 
who do not believe in the Hereafter a concealed partition.692
46.And We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they
understand it, and in their ears deafness.  And when you mention 
your Lord alone in the QurÕ Œn, they turn back in aversion.
47.We are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen 
to you and [of] when they are in private conversation, when the
wrongdoers say, "You follow not but a man affected by magic."
48.Look how they strike for you comparisons;693but they have 
strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.
49.And they say, "When we are bones and crumbled particles, 
will we [truly] be resurr ected as a new creation?"
50.Say, "Be you stones or iron694
51.Or [any] creation of that which is great695within your breasts."  
And they will say, "Who will restore us?"  Say, "He who 
brought you forth the first time."  Then they will nod their 
heads towar d you696and say, "When is that?"  Say, "Perhaps it 
will be soon –
52.On the Day He will call you and you will respond with praise 
of Him and think that you had not remained [in the world] 
except for a little."
53.And tell My servants to say that which is best.  Indeed, Satan 
induces [dissension] among them.  Indeed Satan is ever, to 
mankind, a clear enemy.

26954.Your Lord is most knowing of you.  If He wills, He will have 
mercy upon you; or if He wills, He will punish you.  And We 
have not sent you, [O Muúam mad], over them as a manager.
55.And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens 
and the earth.  And We have made some of the prophets 
exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the 
book [of Psalms].
56.Say, "Invoke those you have claimed [as gods] besides Him, 
for they do not possess the [ability for] removal of adversity 
from you or [for its] transfer [to someone else]."
57.Those whom they invoke697seek means of access to their Lord,
[striving as to] which of them would be nearest, and they hope 
for His mercy and fear His punishment.  Indeed, the punishment
of your Lord is ever feared.
58.And there is no city but that We will destroy it698before the 
Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment.  
That has ever been in th e Register699inscribed.
59.And nothing has prevented Us from sending signs [i.e., miracles]
except that the former peoples denied them.  And We gave 
Tham´d the she -camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her.  
And We send not the signs except as a warnin g.
60.And [remember, O Muúammad ], when We told you, "Indeed, 
your Lord has encompassed the people."700  And We did not 
make the sight which We showed you701except as a trial for 
the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the QurÕŒn.  
And We threaten [i.e., warn] them, but it increases them not 
except in great transgression.

27061.And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam,"
and they prostrated, except for Iblees.702  He said, "Should I 
prostrate to one You created from clay?"
62.[Iblee s] said, "Do You see this one whom You have honored 
above me?  If You delay me [i.e., my death] until the Day of 
Resurrection, I will surely destroy703his descendants, except 
for a few."
63.[AllŒh] said, "Go, for whoever of them follows you, indeed Hell 
will be the recompense of [all of] you –an ample recompense.
64.And incite [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with 
your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers 
and become a partner in their wealth and their children and
promise them."  But Satan does not promise them except delusion.
65.Indeed, over My [believing] servants there is for you no authority.   
And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs.
66.It is your Lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that
you may seek of His bounty.  Indeed, He is ever, to you, Merciful.
67.And when adversity touches you at sea, lost are [all] those you 
invoke except for Him.  But when He delivers you to the land, 
you turn away [from Him].  And ever is man ungrateful.
68.Then do you feel secure that [instead] He will not cause a part of 
the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones?   
Then you would not find for yourselves an advocate.
69.Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back into it 
[i.e., the sea] another time and send upon you a hurricane of 
wind and drown you for what you denied?704  Then you would 
not find for yourselves against Us an avenger.705
70.And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and 
carried them on the land and sea and provi ded for them of the

271good things and preferred them over much of what We have 
created, with [definite] preference.
71.[Mention, O Muúammad ], the Day We will call forth every 
people with their record [of deeds].706  Then whoever is given 
his record in his rig ht hand –those will read their records, and 
injustice will not be done to them, [even] as much as a thread 
[inside the date seed].
72.And whoever is blin d707in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter
and more astray in way.
73.And indeed, they were ab out to tempt you away from that which 
We revealed to you in order to [make] you invent about Us 
something else; and then they would have taken you as a friend.
74.And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost 
inclined to them a little.
75.Then [if you had], We would have made you taste double 
[punishment in] life and double [after] death.  Then you would 
not find for yourself against Us a helper.
76.And indeed, they were about to provoke [i.e., drive] you from 
the land [i.e., Makkah] to evict you therefrom.  And then 
[when they do], they will not remain [there] after you, except 
for a little.708
77.[That is Our] established way for those We had sent before 
you of Our messengers; and you will not find in Our way any 
alteration.
78.Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] 
until the darkness of the night709and [also] the QurÕŒn [i.e., 
recitation] of dawn.710  Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever 
witnessed.
                                               
706Other meanings are "with their leader" or "with that whic h they had followed."707i.e., refusing to see the truth.708Only ten years after the Prophet's emigration, Makkah was completely 
cleared of his enemies.709i.e., the period which includes the thuhr, a§r, maghrib, and ÔishŒÕ prayers.710i.e., the fajr prayer, in w hich the recitation of the QurÕ Œn is prolonged.

S´rah 17–al-IsrŒÕ JuzÕ 15
27279.And from [part of] the night, pray711with it [i.e., recitation of 
the QurÕ Œn] as additional [worship] for you; it is expected tha t712
your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.713
80.And say, "My Lord, cause me to enter a sound entrance714and 
to exit a sound exit715and grant me from Yourself a supporting
authority."
81.And say, "Truth has come, and falsehood has departed.  Indeed
is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart."
82.And We send down of the QurÕ Œn that which is healing and mercy
for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers 
except in loss.
83.And when We bestow favor upon man [i.e., the disbeliever], 
he turns away and distances himself; and when evil touches 
him, he is ever despairing.
84.Say, "Each works according to his manner, but your Lord is 
most knowing of who is best guided in way."
85.And they ask you, [O Muúammad ], about the soul.  Say, "The 
soul is of the affair [i.e., concern] of my Lord.  And you [i.e., 
mankind] have not been given of knowledge except a little."
86.And if We willed, We could surely do away with that which 
We revealed to you.  Then you would not find for yourself 
concerning it an advocate against Us.
87.Except [We have left it with you] as a mercy from your Lord.  
Indeed, His favor upon you has ever been great.
88.Say, "If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the 
like of this QurÕ Œn, they could not produce the like of it, even 
if they were to each other assistants."

degree in Paradise.714Into Mad¥nah at the time of emigration, or into the grave.715From Makkah, or from the grave at the time of resurrection.

27389.And We have certainly diversified for the people in this QurÕ Œn
from every [kind of] example, but most of the people refused 
except disbelief.
90.And they say, "We will not believe you until you break open 
for us from the ground a spring
91.Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and 
make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance]
92.Or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have 
claimed or you bring All Œh and the angels before [us]
93.Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend 
into the sky.  And [even then], we will not believe in your 
ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read."  
Say, "Exalted is my Lord!  Was I ever but a human messenger?"
94.And what prevented the people from believing when guidance 
came to them except that they said, "Has AllŒh sent a human 
messenger?"
95.Say, "If there were upon the earth a ngels walking securely,716
We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel 
[as a] messenger."
96.Say, "Sufficient is All Œh as Witness between me and you.  Indeed 
He is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."
97.And whoever AllŒh guides –he is the [rightly] guided; and 
whoever He sends astray717–you will never find for them 
protectors besides Him, and We will gather them on the Day 
of Resurrection [fallen] on their faces –blind, dumb and deaf.  
Their refuge is Hell; every time it su bsides We increase them 
in blazing fire.
98.That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our verses 
and said, "When we are bones and crumbled particles, will we 
[truly] be resurrected [in] a new creation?"

27499.Do they not see that All Œh, who crea ted the heavens and earth, 
is [the one] Able to create the likes of them?  And He has 
appointed for them a term, about which there is no doubt.  But 
the wrongdoers refuse except disbelief.
100.Say [to them], "If you possessed the depositories of the mercy
of my Lord, then you would withhold out of fear of spending."   
And ever has man been stingy.
101.And We had certainly given Moses nine evident signs, so ask 
the Children of Israel [about] when he came to them and 
Pharaoh said to him, "Indeed I think, O Moses, that you are 
affected by magic."
102.[Moses] said, "You have already known that none has sent 
down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the 
earth as evidence, and indeed I think,718O Pharaoh, that you 
are destroyed."
103.So he intended to drive them from the land, but We drowned 
him and those with him all together.
104.And We said after him [i.e., Pharaoh] to the Children of Israel, 
"Dwell in the land, and when there comes the promise [i.e., 
appointment] of the Hereafter, We will bring you forth in 
[one] gathering."
105.And with the truth We have sent it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] down, and 
with the truth is has descended.  And We have not sent you, 
[O Muúammad ], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.
106.And [it is] a QurÕŒn which We have separated [by intervals] 
that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period.  
And We have sent it down progressively.
107.Say, "Believe in it or do not believe."  Indeed, those who were 
given knowledge before it719–when it is recited to them, they 
fall upon their faces in prostration,
                                               
718i.e., I am certain.719i.e., the righteous among the People of the Scriptures who recognize the 
truth contained in the QurÕ Œn.

275108.And they say, "Exalted is our Lord!  Indeed, the promise of 
our Lord has been fulfilled."
109.And they fall upon their faces weeping, and it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn]
increases them in humble submission.
110.Say, "Call upon AllŒh or call upon the Most Merciful 
[ar-RaúmŒn].  Whichever [name] you call –to Him belong the 
best names."  And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or 
[too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way.
111.And say, "Pra ise to AllŒh, who has not taken a son and has had 
no partner in [His] dominion and has no [need of a] protector
out of weakness; and glorify Him with [great] glorification."

1.[All] praise is [due] to AllŒh, who has sent down upon His 
Servant [ Muúammad ()] the Book and has not made therein 
any deviance.721
2.[He has made it] straight, to warn of severe punishment from
Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous 
deeds that they will have a goo d reward [i.e., Paradise]
3.In which they will remain forever
4.And to warn those who say, "All Œh has taken a son."
5.They have no knowledge of it,722nor had their fathers.  Grave 
is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not 
except a lie .
6.Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, 
[O Muúammad ], if they do not believe in this message, [and] 
out of sorrow.
7.Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for 
it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.
8.And indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren 
ground.
9.Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the 
inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?723
10.[Mention] when the youths retreated to the cave and said, 
"Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us 
from our affair right guidance."
11.So We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ears within the cave 
for a number of years.
                                               
720Al-Kahf :  The Cave.721From the truth or the straight path.722i.e., they could n ot have had knowledge of something which is not true.723Rather, it is only one of the many wonders of All Œh.

Page 299:
S´rah 18–al-Kahf JuzÕ 15
27712.Then We awakened them that We might show which of the 
two factions was most precise in calculating what [extent] 
they had remained in time.
13.It is We who relate to you, [O Muúammad ], their story in truth.   
Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We 
increased them in guidance.
14.And We bound [i.e., made firm] their hearts when they stood 
up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.   
Never will we invoke besides Him any deity.  We would have 
certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.
15.These, our people, have taken besides Him deities.  Why do 
they not bring for [worship of] them a clear authority?  And 
who is more unjust than one who invents about All Œh a lie?"
16.[The youths said to one another], "And when you have withdrawn
from them and that which they worship other than AllŒh, 
retreat to the cave.  Your Lord will spread out for you of His 
mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility."
17.And [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose,
inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, 
passing away from them on the left, while they were [laying] 
within an open space thereof.  That was from the signs of All Œh.  
He whom All Œh guides is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He
leaves astray –never will you find for him a protecting g uide.
18.And you would think them awake, while they were asleep.  
And We turned them to the right and to the left, while their 
dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance.  If you had looked 
at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been 
filled by them with terror.
19.And similarly,724We awakened them that they might question 
one another.  Said a speaker from among them, "How long 
have you remained [here]?"  They said, "We have remained a 
day or part of a day."  They said, "Your Lord is most kn owing 
                                               
724By the will of All Œh.

278of how long you remained.  So send one of you with this 
silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the 
best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be 
cautious.  And let no one be aware of you.
20.Indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or 
return you to their religion.  And never would you succeed, 
then –ever."
21.And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who 
found them] would know that the promise of AllŒh is truth 
and that of the Hour the re is no doubt.  [That was] when they725
disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, 
"Construct over them a structure.  Their Lord is most knowing 
about them."  Said those who prevailed in the matter, "We 
will surely take [for ourselves] ov er them a masjid."726
22.They [i.e., people] will say there were three, the fourth of them
being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of 
them being their dog –guessing at the unseen; and they will 
say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog.  
Say, [O Muúammad ], "My Lord is most knowing of their number.   
None knows them except a few.  So do not argue about them 
except with an obvious argument727and do not inquire about 
them among [the speculators] from anyone."
23.And never say of anything, "Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,"
24.Except [when adding], "If AllŒh wills."  And remember your 
Lord when you forget [it] and say, "Perhaps my Lord will 
guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct."
25.And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and 
exceeded by nine.728
26.Say, "AllŒh is most knowing of how long they remained.  He has
                                               
725The people of the city.726i.e., we will make this site a place of worship.727i.e., one from the QurÕ Œn, which is the only sure argument.728According to the lunar calendar.

279[knowledge of] the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth.   
How Seeing is He and how Hearing!  They have not besides Him
any pr otector, and He shares not His legislation with anyone."
27.And recite, [O Muúammad ], what has been revealed to you of 
the Book of your Lord.  There is no changer of His words, and 
never will you find in other than Him a refuge.
28.And keep yourself pati ent [by being] with those who call upon 
their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His 
countenance.  And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring
adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose 
heart We have made heedless of Our remem brance and who 
follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.729
29.And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills –let 
him believe; and whoever wills –let him disbelieve."  Indeed, 
We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will 
surround them.  And if they call for relief, they will be relieved
with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces.  Wretched
is the drink, and evil is the resting place.
30.Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds –
indeed, W e will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did 
well in deeds.
31.Those will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them 
rivers will flow.  They will be adorned therein with bracelets 
of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and broca de, 
reclining therein on adorned couches.  Excellent is the reward, 
and good is the resting place.
32.And present to them an example of two men:  We granted to 
one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them
with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops.
33.Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short

28034.And he had fruit, so he said to his companion while he was 
conversing with him, "I am greater than you in wealth and 
mightier in [numbers of] men."
35.And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself.730  
He said, "I do not think that this will perish –ever.
36.And I do not think the Hour will occur.  And even if I should 
be brough t back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this 
as a return."
37.His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, 
"Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and 
then from a sperm -drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?
38.But as for me, He is All Œh, my Lord, and I do not associate 
with my Lord anyone.
39.And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What
AllŒh willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in All Œh'?  
Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,
40.It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than 
your garden and will send upon it a calamity from the sky, and 
it will become a smooth, dusty ground,
41.Or its water will become sunken [into the earth], so you would 
never be able to seek it."
42.And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to 
turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, 
while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, "Oh, I wish I 
had not associated with my Lord anyone."731
43.And there was for him no company to aid him other than All Œh,
nor could he defend himself.
44.There732the authority is [completely] for All Œh, the Truth.  He 
is best in reward and best in outcome.
                                               
730i.e., proud and ungrateful to All Œh.731He attributed his prosperity to himself rather than to All Œh and disbelieved 
in the account of the Hereafter.732i.e., at such a time or on the Day of Judgement.

28145.And present to them the example of the life of this wo rld, [its 
being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the 
vegetation of the earth mingles with it733and [then] it becomes 
dry remnants, scattered by the winds.  And All Œh is ever, over 
all things, Perfect in Ability.
46.Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life.  
But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord734for 
reward and better for [one's] hope.
47.And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains 
and you will see the earth prominent,735and We will gather 
them and not leave behind from them anyone.
48.And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He 
will say], "You have certainly come to Us just as We created 
you the first time.  But you claimed that We would never make
for you an appointment."
49.And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will 
see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, 
"Oh, woe to us!  What is this book that leaves nothing small 
or great except that it has enumerated it?"  And they will find 
what they did present [before them].  And your Lord does 
injustice to no one.
50.And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam,"
and they prostrated, except for Iblees.  He was of the jinn and 
departed from [i.e., disobeyed] the command of his Lord.   
Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other 
than Me while they are enemies to you?  Wretched it is for the 
wrongdoers as an exchange.
51.I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and 
the earth or to the creation of themse lves, and I would not 
have taken the misguiders as assistants.

28252.And [warn of] the Day when He will say, "Call 'My partners' 
whom you claimed," and they will invoke them, but they will 
not respond to them.  And We will put between them [a valley 
of] dest ruction.
53.And the criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they
are to fall therein.  And they will not find from it a way elsewhere.
54.And We have certainly diversified in this QurÕ Œn for the people
from every [kind of] example; but man h as ever been, most of 
anything, [prone to] dispute.
55.And nothing has prevented the people from believing when 
guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their 
Lord except that there [must] befall them the [accustomed] 
precedent of the former peoples736or that the punishment 
should come [directly] before them.
56.And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good 
tidings and warners.  And those who disbelieve dispute by 
[using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth 
and ha ve taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, 
in ridicule.
57.And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the 
verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what 
his hands have put forth?  Indeed, We have placed over their 
hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears 
deafness.  And if you invite them to guidance –they will never
be guided, then –ever.
58.And your Lord is the Forgiving, full of mercy.  If He were to 
impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would 
have hastened for them the punishment.  Rather, for them is 
an appointment from which they will never find an escape.
59.And those cities –We destroyed them when they wronged, 
and We made for their destruction an appointed time.

28360.And [mention] when Moses said to his boy [i.e., servant], "I 
will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two 
seas or continue for a long period."
61.But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot 
their fish, and it took its course into the sea, slipping away.
62.So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, 
"Bring us our morning meal.  We have certainly suffered in this,
our journey, [much] fatigue."
63.He said, "Did you see when we retired to the rock?  Indeed, I 
forgot [there] the fish.  And none made me forget it except 
Satan –that I should mention it.  And it took its course into 
the sea amazingly."
64.[Moses] said, "That is what we were seeking."  So they returned,
following their footprints.
65.And they found a serva nt from among Our servants [i.e., 
al-Khidhr] to whom We had given mercy from Us and had 
taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.
66.Moses said to him, "May I follow you on [the condition] that you 
teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgeme nt?"
67.He said, "Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.
68.And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass
in knowledge?"
69.[Moses] said, "You will find me, if All Œh wills, patient, and I 
will not disobey you in [any] ord er."
70.He said, "Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything 
until I make to you about it mention [i.e., explanation]."
71.So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, he 
[i.e., al -Khidhr] tore it open.  [Moses] said, "Have you tor n it open 
to drown its people?  You have certainly done a grave thing."
72.[Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I not say that with me you would never 
be able to have patience?"
73.[Moses] said, "Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not 
cover me in my matter with difficulty."

Page 306:
S´rah 18–al-Kahf JuzÕ 16
28474.So they set out, until when they met a boy, he [i.e., al -Khidhr] 
killed him.  [Moses] said, "Have you killed a pure soul for 
other than [having killed] a soul?  You have certainly done a 
deplorable thing."
75.[Al-Khidhr] said, "Did I nottell you that with me you would 
never be able to have patience?"
76.[Moses] said, "If I should ask you about anything after this, 
then do not keep me as a companion.  You have obtained from 
me an excuse."
77.So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, 
they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them 
hospitality.  And they found therein a wall about to collapse, 
so he [i.e., al -Khidhr] restored it.  [Moses] said, "If you wished,
you could have taken for it a payment."
78.[Al-Khidhr] said, "This is parting between me and you.  I will 
inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could 
not have patience.
79.As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea.  So 
I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king 
who seized every [good] ship by force.
80.And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared 
that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief.
81.So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one 
better than him in purity and nearer to mercy.
82.And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, 
and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father 
had been righteous.  So your Lord intended that they reach 
maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord.  
And I did it not of my own accord.  That is the interpretation 
of that about which you could not have patience."
83.And they ask you, [O Muúammad ], about Dhul -Qarnayn.  
Say, "I will recite to you about him a re port."
84.Indeed, We established him upon the earth, and We gave him 
to everything a way [i.e., means].

Page 307:
S´rah 18–al-Kahf JuzÕ 16
28585.So he followed a way
86.Until, when he reached the setting of the sun [i.e., the west], 
he found it [as if] setting in a spring of dark mud,737and he 
found near it a people.  We [i.e., All Œh] said, "O Dhul -Qarnayn,
either you punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] 
goodness."
87.He said, "As for one who wrongs,738we will punish him.  Then
he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a 
terrible punishment [i.e., Hellfire].
88.But as for one who believes and does righteousness, he will have a 
reward of the best [ i.e., Paradise ], and we [i.e., Dhul -Qarnayn] 
will speak to him from our command with ease."
89.Then he followed a w ay
90.Until, when he came to the rising of the sun [i.e., the east], he 
found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against 
it any shield.
91.Thus.739  And We had encompassed [all] that he had in 
knowledge.
92.Then he followed a way
93.Until, wh en he reached [a pass] between two mountains, he found
beside them a people who could hardly understand [his] speech.
94.They said, "O Dhul -Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog740are 
[great] corrupters in the land.  So may we assign for you an 
expenditure that you might make between us and them a 
barrier?"
95.He said, "That in which my Lord has established me is better 
[than what you offer], but assist me with strength [i.e., 
manpower]; I will make between you and them a dam.
                                               
737Another meaning is "a hot spring."738Persists in disbelief and rebelli on.739Such was the affair of Dhul -Qurnayn.740Savage tribes who had ravaged large parts of central Asia, committing 
every kind of atrocity.

28696.Bring me sheets of iron" –until, when he had leveled [them] 
between the two mountain walls, he said, "Blow [with bellows],"
until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, "Bring me, that I 
may pour over it molten copper."
97.So they [i.e., Gog and Magog] were unable to pass over it, nor 
were they able [to effect] in it any penetration.
98.[Dhul -Qarnayn] said, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but 
when the promise of my Lord741comes [i.e., approaches], He 
will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true."
99.And We will leave them that day742surging over each other, 
and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will assemble 
them in [one] assembly.
100.And We will present Hell that Day to the disbelievers, on 
display –
101.Those whose eyes had been within a cover [removed] from 
My remembrance,743and they were not able to hear.744
102.Then do those who disbelieve think that they can take My 
servants instead of Me as allies?  Indeed, We have prepared 
Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging.
103.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Shall we [believers ] inform you of the 
greatest losers as to [their] deeds?
104.[They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while 
they think that they are doing well in work."
105.Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord
and in [their] meeti ng Him, so their deeds have become worthless;
and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection 
any weight [i.e., importance].
106.That is their recompense –Hell –for what they denied and 
[because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicul e.
                                               
741i.e., the Hour of Resurrection.742The day the dam is destroyed.743i.e., All Œh's signs or the QurÕ Œn.744They refused to li sten to the QurÕ Œn or to understand it.

287107.Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds –
they will have the Gardens of Paradise745as a lodging,
108.Wherein they abide eternally.  They will not desire from it any 
transfer.
109.Say, "If the sea were ink for [writing] the word s746of my Lord, 
the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were 
exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement."
110.Say, "I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed 
that your god is one God.  So whoever would hope for the 
meeting with his Lord –let him do righteous work and not 
associate in the worship of his Lord anyone."

2.[This is] a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant 
Zechariah
3.When he called to his Lord a private call [i.e., supplication].
4.He said, "My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my 
head has filled749with white, and never have I been in my 
supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy [i.e., disappointed].
5.And indeed, I fear the successors750after me, and my wife has 
been barren, so give me from Yourself an heir
6.Who will inherit me751and inherit from the family of Jacob.  
And make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You]."
7.[He was told],752"O Zechariah, indeed We give you g ood tidings 
of a boy whose name will be John.  We have not assigned to 
anybefore [this] name."
8.He said, "My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has 
been barren and I have reached extreme old age?"
9.[An angel] said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy 
for Me, for I created you before, while you were nothing. '"
10.[Zechariah] said, "My Lord, make for me a sign."  He said, 
"Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three 
nights, [being] soun d."753

28911.So he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and
signaled to them to exalt [All Œh] in the morning and afternoon.
12.[AllŒh said], "O John, take the Scripture [i.e., adhere to it] with 
determination."  And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy
13.And affection from U s and purity, and he was fearing of All Œh
14.And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant.
15.And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he 
dies and the day he is raised alive.
16.And mention, [O Muúammad ], in the Book [the story of] Mary,
when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.
17.And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen.  Then We sent 
to her Our Angel [i.e., Gabriel], and he represented himself to 
her as a well -proportioned man.
18.She said, " Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you,
[so leave me], if you should be fearing of All Œh."
19.He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you 
[news of] a pure boy [i.e., son]."
20.She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched 
me and I have not been unchaste?"
21.He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, 
and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us.   
And it is a matter [already] decreed. '"
22.So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote 
place.
23.And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm 
tree.  She said, "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in 
oblivion, forgotten."
24.But he754called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord
has provided beneath you a stream.

29025.And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop 
upon you ripe, fresh dates.
26.So eat and drink and be contented.  And if you see from among
humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful
abstenti on, so I will not speak today to [any] man. '"
27.Then she brought him to her people, carrying him.  They said, 
"O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.
28.O sister [i.e., descendant] of Aaron, your father was not a man 
of evil, nor was you r mother unchaste."
29.So she pointed to him.  They said, "How can we speak to one 
who is in the cradle a child?"
30.[Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of All Œh.  He has given 
me the Scripture and made me a prophet.
31.And He has made me blessed wh erever I am and has enjoined 
upon me prayer and zakŒh as long as I remain alive
32.And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made 
me a wretched tyrant.
33.And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die 
and the day I am raised alive ."
34.That is Jesus, the son of Mary –the word of truth about which 
they are in dispute.
35.It is not [befitting] for AllŒh to take a son; exalted is He!755  
When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.
36.[Jesus said], "And indeed, Al lŒh is my Lord and your Lord, so 
worship Him.  That is a straight path."
37.Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them,
so woe to those who disbelieved –from the scene of a tremendous
Day.
38.How [clearly] they will hear and see the D ay they come to Us, 
but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.

29139.And warn them, [O Muúammad ], of the Day of Regret, when 
the matter will be concluded;756and [yet], they are in [a state 
of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.
40.Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it,
and to Us they will be returned.
41.And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham.  Indeed, he 
was a man of truth and a prophet.
42.[Mention] when he said to his father, "O my father, why do 
you worship that which does not hear and does not see and 
will not benefit you at all?
43.O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that 
which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to 
an even path.
44.O my father, do not worship [i.e., obey] Satan.  Indeed Satan 
has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.
45.O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment
from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion
[in Hellfire]."
46.[His father] said, "Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham?   
If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a 
prolonged time."
47.[Abraham] said, "Peace [i.e., safety] will be upon you.757  I 
will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord.  Indeed, He is ever 
gracious to me.
48.And I w ill leave you and those you invoke other than All Œh and 
will invoke my Lord.  I expect that I will not be in invocation 
tomy Lord unhappy [i.e., disappointed]."
49.So when he had left them and those they worshipped other 
than All Œh, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] 
We made a prophet.

29250.And We gave them of Our mercy, and We made for them a 
mention [i.e., reputation] of high honor.
51.And mention in the Book, Moses.  Indeed, he was chosen, and 
he was a messenger and a prophet.758
52.And We called him from the side of the mount759at [his] right 
and brought him near, confiding [to him].
53.And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a 
prophet.
54.And mention in the Book, Ishmael.  Indeed, he was true to his 
promise, and he was a mes senger and a prophet.
55.And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zakŒh and was 
to his Lord pleasing [i.e., accepted by Him].
56.And mention in the Book, Idrees.  Indeed, he was a man of 
truth and a prophet.
57.And We raised him to a high station.
58.Those were the ones upon whom AllŒh bestowed favor from 
among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those 
We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of 
Abraham and Israel [i.e., Jacob], and of those whom We 
guided and chose.  When the verses of the Most Merciful were 
recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.
59.But there came after them successors [i.e., later generations] 
who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going 
to meet evil760–

those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.

promise has ever been eminent .761
62.They will not hear therein any ill speech –only [greetings of] 
peace –and they will have their provision therein, morning

63.That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our 
servants who were fearing of All Œh.
64.[Gabriel said],762"And we [angels] descend not except by the 
order of your Lord.  To Him belongs that before us and that 
behind us and what is in between.  And never is your Lord 
forgetful –
65.Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between 
them –so worship Him and have patience for His worship.  
Do you know of any similarity to Him?"
66.And man [i.e., the disbeliever] says, "When I have died, am I 
going to be brought forth alive?"
67.Does man not remember that We created him before, while h e 
was nothing?
68.So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; 
then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their 
knees.763
69.Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them 
who were worst against the Most Merciful in in solence.
70.Then, surely it is W e who are most knowing of those most 
worthy of burning therein.
71.And there is none of you except he will come to it.764  This is 
upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.
                                               
761Literally, "that to which all will come."762In answer to the Prophet's wish that Gabriel would visit him more often.763i.e., fallen on their knees from t error or dragged there unwillingly on their 
knees.764i.e., be exposed to it.  However, the people of Paradise will not be harmed 
thereby.

29472.Then We will save those who feared AllŒh and leave the 
wrongdoers within it, on their knees.
73.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] 
two parties is best in position and best in association?"765
74.And how many a genera tion have We destroyed before them 
who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?
75.Say, "Whoever is in error –let the Most Merciful extend for him 
an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that 
which they were promised –either p unishment [in this world] 
or the Hour [of resurrection] –they will come to know who is 
worst in position and weaker in soldiers."
76.And All Œh increases those who were guided, in guidance, and 
the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord766for reward 
and better for recourse.
77.Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said,
"I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]"?
78.Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most 
Merciful a promise?
79.No!  We will record what he says and extend [i.e., increase] 
for him from the punishment extensively.
80.And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions,767and he will 
come to Us alone.
81.And they have taken besides AllŒh [false] deities that they 
would be for them [ a source of] honor.
82.No!  They [i.e., those "gods"] will deny their worship of them
and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].
83.Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers,
inciting them [to evil] with [consta nt] incitement?
                                               
765In regard to worldly interests.766i.e., in the sight or evaluation of All Œh.767Instead of giving him wealth and children in the Hereafter, AllŒh will 
take from him those he had in worldly life at the time of his death.

S´rah 19–Maryam JuzÕ 16
29584.So be not impatient over them.  We only count out [i.e., allow]
to them a [limited] number.768
85.On the Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful 
as a delegation
86.And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst
87.None wi ll have [power of] intercession except he who had taken
from the Most Merciful a covenant.769
88.And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son."
89.You have done an atrocious thing.
90.The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth sp lits open
and the mountains collapse in devastation
91.That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.
92.And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should 
take a son.
93.There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to 
the Mos t Merciful as a servant.
94.He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.
95.And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection
alone.
96.Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds –
the Most Merciful will appoint fo r them affection.770
97.So, [O Muúammad ], We have only made it [i.e., the QurÕŒn] 
easy in your tongue [i.e., the Arabic language] that you may 
give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a 
hostile people.
98.And how many have We destroyed b efore them of generations?   
Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?
                                               
768Of breaths, of days, or of evil deeds.769Not to worship other than Him.770From Himself and from among each other.

10.When he saw a fire and said to his fa mily, "Stay here; indeed, 
I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you a torch or find

29716.So do not let one avert you from it775who does not believe in 
it and follows his desire, for you [then] would perish.
17.And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?"
18.He said, "I t is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves 
for my sheep and I have therein other uses."
19.[AllŒh] said, "Throw it down, O Moses."
20.So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a snake, moving 
swiftly.
21.[AllŒh] said, "Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its 
former condition.
22.And draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white 
without disease –another sign,
23.That We may show you [some] of Our greater signs.
24.Go to Pharaoh.  Indeed, he has transgressed [i.e., tyranniz ed]."
25.[Moses] said, "My Lord, expand [i.e., relax] for me my breast 
[with assurance]
26.And ease for me my task
27.And untie the knot from my tongue 
28.That they may understand my speech.
29.And appoint for me a minister [i.e., assistant] from my family –
30.Aaron, my brother.
31.Increase through him my strength
32.And let him share my task
33.That we may exalt You much
34.And remember You much.
35.Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing."
36.[AllŒh] said, "You have been granted your request, O Mo ses.

29837.And We had already conferred favor upon you another time,
38.When We inspired to your mother what We inspired,
39.[Saying], 'Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and 
the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an 
enemy to Me and an enemy to him.'  And I bestowed upon you 
love from Me776that you would be brought up under My eye 
[i.e., observation and care].
40.[And We favored you] when your sister went and said, 'Shall I 
direct you to someone who will be responsible f or him?'  So We
restored you to your mother that she might be content and not 
grieve.  And you killed someone,777but We saved you from 
retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial.  And you remained
[some] years among the people of Madyan.  Then you came
[here] at the decreed time, O Moses.
41.And I produced you for Myself.778
42.Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken 
in My remembrance.
43.Go, both of you, to Pharaoh.  Indeed, he has transgressed.
44.And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be 
reminded or fear [All Œh]."
45.They said, "Our Lord, indeed we are afraid that he will hasten 
[punishment] against us or that he will transgress."
46.[AllŒh] said, "Fear not.  Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and 
I see.
47.So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord,
so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them.   
We have come to you with a sign from your Lord.  And peace779
will be upon he who follows the guidance.
                                               
776AllŒh put love o f Moses into the hearts of the people.777The Copt who died after being struck by Moses.778AllŒh had already selected Moses and made him strong in body and 
character according to the requirements of his mission.779i.e., safety and security from All Œh's punishm ent.

Page 321:
S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
29948.Indeed, it has been revea led to us that the punishment will be 
upon whoever denies and turns away. '"
49.[Pharaoh] said, "So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?"
50.He said, "Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and 
then guided [it]."
51.[Pharaoh] said, "Then what is the case of the former generations?"
52.[Moses] said, "The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a 
record.   My Lord neither errs nor forgets."
53.[It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] 
and inserted therein for you roadways and sent d own from the 
sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.
54.Eat [therefrom] and pasture your livestock.  Indeed in that are 
signs for those of intelligence.
55.From it [i.e., the earth] We created you, and into it We will 
return you, and from it We will extract you another time.
56.And We certainly showed him [i.e., Pharaoh] Our signs –all 
of them –but he denied and refused.
57.He said, "Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with 
your magic, O Moses?
58.Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between 
us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and 
neither will you, in a place assigned."780
59.[Moses] said, "Your appointment is on the day of the festival 
when the people assemble at mid -morning."781
60.So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came 
[to Moses].
61.Moses said to them [i.e., the magicians summoned by Pharaoh],
"Woe to you!  Do not invent a lie against AllŒh or He will 
exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who 
invents [such falsehood]."
                                               
780Literally, "marked," as to be known.  Another meaning is "a place midway
[between us]" or "a level place."781So that the signs of All Œh would be seen clearly.

Page 322:
S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
30062.So they disputed over their affair among themselves and 
concealed their private conversation.
63.They said, "Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive
you out of your land with their magic and do away with your 
most ex emplary way [i.e., religion or tradition].
64.So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line.  
And he has succeeded today who overcomes."
65.They said, "O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first 
to throw."
66.He said, "Rather, you throw."  And suddenly their ropes and 
staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving 
[like snakes].
67.And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses.
68.We [i.e., All Œh] said, "Fear not.  Indeed, it is you who are superior.
69.And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what 
they have crafted.  What they have crafted is but the trick of a 
magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is."
70.So the magicians fell down in prostration.782  They said, "We 
have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."
71.[Pharaoh] said, "You believed him [i.e., Moses] before I gave 
you permission.  Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you 
magic.  So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on 
opposite sides, and I will crucif y you on the trunks of palm trees,
and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] 
punishment and more enduring."
72.They said, "Never will we prefer you over what has come to 
us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us.783  So decree 
whatever you are to decree.  You can only decree for this 
worldly life.
                                               
782After they had seen the miracles which AllŒh had given Moses and that 
they were realities a nd not merely impressions of magic.783This phrase has also been interpreted as an oath, i.e., "...by Him who 
created us."

Page 323:
S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
30173.Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us 
our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic.  And 
AllŒh is better and more enduring."784
74.Indeed, whoever comes t o his Lord as a criminal –indeed, for 
him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live.
75.But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous
deeds –for those will be the highest degrees [in position]:
76.Gardens of perpetual residence benea th which rivers flow, 
wherein they abide eternally.  And that is the reward of one 
who purifies himself.785
77.And We had inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My 
servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you 
will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of 
drowning]."
78.So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered 
them from the sea that which covered them,786
79.And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them].
80.O Children of Israel, We delivered y ou from your enemy, and 
We made an appointment with you787at the right side of the 
mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,
81.[Saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have 
provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, 
lest My anger should descend upon you.  And he upon whom 
My anger descends has certainly fallen [i.e., perished]."
82.But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and
believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.
83.[AllŒh said], "And what made you hasten from your people, O 
Moses?"
                                               
784In reward and in punishment.785From all uncleanliness, the greatest of which is worship and obedience to 
other than All Œh.786i.e., not only the water but that which only AllŒh knows –terror, pain, 
regret, etc.787i.e., with your prophet, to receive the scripture for you.

Page 324:
S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
30284.He said, "They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You,
my Lord, that You be pleased."
85.[AllŒh] said, "But indeed, We have tried your people after you 
[departed], and the SŒmir¥788has led them astray."
86.So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved.789  He said,
"O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise ?790  
Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did 
you wish that wrath from your Lord descend up on you, so you 
broke your promise [of obedience] to me?"
87.They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our will, 
but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the 
people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus 
did the SŒ mir¥ throw."
88.And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a 
lowing sound, and they said, "This is your god and the god of 
Moses, but he forgot."
89.Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech 
[i.e., response] and that itdid not possess for them any harm 
or benefit?
90.And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], 
"O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, 
your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order."
91.They said, "We will never cease being devoted to it [i.e., the 
calf] until Moses returns to us."
92.[Moses] said, "O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw 
them going astray,
93.From following me?  Then have you disobeyed my order?"
94.[Aaron] said, "O son of my moth er, do not seize [me] by my 
beard or by my head.  Indeed, I feared that you would say, 
                                               
788Translated as "the Samaritan" (from Samaria), a hypocrite among them 
who led the Children of Israel into idol -worship.789The meaning may also be "angry and enraged."790That He would send down the Torah, containing guidance for you.

S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
303'You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you 
did not observe [or await] my word. '"
95.[Moses] said, "And what is your case, O SŒmir¥?"
96.He said, "I s aw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust]
from the track of the messenger791and threw it,792and thus did 
my soul entice me."
97.[Moses] said, "Then go.  And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in 
[this] life to say, 'No contact. '793  And indeed, you have an 
appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep.  And look
at your 'god' to which you remained devoted.  We will surely 
burn it and blow it [i.e., its ashes] into the sea with a blast.
98.Your god is only All Œh, except for whom there i s no deity.  He 
has encompassed all things in knowledge."
99.Thus, [O Muúammad ], We relate to you from the news of what
has preceded.  And We have certainly given you from Us a 
message [i.e., the QurÕ Œn].
100.Whoever turns away from it –then indeed, he will bear on the 
Day of Resurrection a burden [i.e., great sin],
101.[Abiding] eternally therein,794and evil it is for them on the 
Day of Resurrection as a load –
102.The Day the Horn will be blown.  And We will gather the 
criminals, that Day, blue -eyed.795
103.They will murmur among themselves, "You remained not but 
ten [days in the world]."
104.We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them 
in manner [i.e., wisdom or speech] will say, "You remained 
not but one day."
                                               
791i.e., a hoof -print in the sand left by the angel Gabriel's horse.792Into the fire upon the melted ornaments in order to form the calf.793i.e., Do n ot touch me.  As chastisement, he was to be completely shunned 
by all people.794i.e., in the state of sin.795From terror, or blinded completely.

S´rah 20–$Œ HŒ JuzÕ 16
304105.And they ask you abo ut the mountains, so say, "My Lord will 
blow them away with a blast.796
106.And He will leave it [i.e., the earth] a level plain;
107.You will not see therein a depression or an elevation."
108.That Day, they [i.e., everyone] will follow [the call of] the
Caller797[with] no deviation therefrom, and [all] voices will 
be stilled before the Most Merciful, so you will not hear except
a whisper [of footsteps].
109.That Day, no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to 
whom the Most Merciful has given pe rmission and has accepted
his word.
110.He [i.e., AllŒh] knows what is [presently] before them and 
what will be after them,798but they do not encompass it [i.e., 
what He knows] in knowledge.
111.And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever -Living, the 
Sustainer of existence.  And he will have failed who carries 
injustice.799
112.But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer –he 
will neither fear injustice nor deprivation.
113.And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic QurÕŒn800and 
have diver sified therein the warnings that perhaps they will 
avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance.
114.So high [above all] is All Œh, the Sovereign, the Truth.  And, 
[O Muúammad ], do not hasten with [recitation of] the QurÕ Œn 
before its revelation is compl eted to you, and say, "My Lord, 
increase me in knowledge."
115.And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but 
he forgot; and We found not in him determination.801
                                               
796Once they have been reduced to dust.797To the gathering for judgement.798See footnote to 2:255 .799i.e., sin or wron gdoing towards All Œh or any of His creation.800i.e., revealed in the Arabic language.801To resist temptation.

305116.And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam,"
and they prostra ted, except Iblees;802he refused.
117.So We said, "O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to 
your wife.  Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you 
would suffer.
118.Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be 
unclothed.
119.And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun."
120.Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct 
you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"
121.And they [i.e., Adam and his wife] ate of it, and their private 
parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten over 
themselves from the leaves of Paradise.  And Adam disobeyed 
his Lord and erred.
122.Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and 
guided [him].
123.[AllŒh] said, "Descend from it [i.e., Paradise] –all, [your 
descendants] being enemies to one another.  And if there should
come to you guidance from Me –then whoever follows My 
guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the 
Hereafter].
124.And whoever turns away from My remembrance –indeed, he 
will have a depressed [i.e., difficult] life, and We will gather 
[i.e., raise] him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
125.He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I 
was [once] seeing?"
126.[AllŒh] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot
[i.e., disregarded] them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten."
127.And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not 
believe in the signs of his Lord.  And the punishment of the 
Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.803

306128.Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations 
We destroyed before them as they walk among their 
dwellings?  Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.
129.And if not for a wor d804that preceded from your Lord, it [i.e., 
punishment] would have been an obligation [due immediately],805
and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].
130.So be patient over what they say and exalt [All Œh] with praise 
of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; 
and during periods of the night [exalt Him] and at the ends of 
the day, that you may be satisfied.
131.And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have 
given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] 
the s plendor of worldly life by which We test them.  And the 
provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.
132.And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be 
steadfast therein.  We ask you not for provision; We provide 
for you, and the [best] out come is for [those of] righteousness.
133.And they say, "Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?"   
Has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former
scriptures?806
134.And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him ,807
they woul d have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us 
a messenger so we could have followed Your verses [i.e., 
teachings] before we were humiliated and disgraced?"
135.Say, "Each [of us] is waiting;808so wait.  For you will know 
who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided."
                                               
804See footnote to 10:19 .805AllŒh would have punished the disbelievers in this world as He did with 
previous peoples.806Is not the QurÕŒn an adequate proof of Muúammad's prophethood and 
sufficient as a lasting miracle?807Prophet Muúammad ( ).  Also interpreted as "before it," i.e., the QurÕ Œn.808For the outcome of this matter.

1.[The time of] their account has approached for the people, 
while they are in heedlessness turning away.
2.No mention [i.e., revelation] comes to them anew from their 
Lord e xcept that they listen to it while they are at play
3.With their hearts distracted.  And those who do wrong conceal 
their private conversation, [saying], "Is this [Prophet] except a 
human being like you?  So would you approach magic while 
you are aware [ of it]?"
4.He [the Prophet ()] said, "My Lord knows whatever is said 
throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the 
Knowing."
5.But they say, "[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams;
rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet.  So let him bring us a 
sign just as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles]."
6.Not a [single] city which We destroyed believed before them ,810
so will they believe?
7.And We sent not before you, [O Muúammad ], except men to 
whom We revealed [the message], so ask thepeople of the 
message [i.e., former scriptures] if you do not know.
8.And We did not make them [i.e., the prophets] forms not eating
food,811nor were they immortal [on earth].
9.Then812We fulfilled for them the promise, and We saved them 
and whom We wil led and destroyed the transgressors.
10.We have certainly sent down to you a Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] 
in which is your mention.813  Then will you not reason?
                                               
809Al-AnbiyŒÕ :  The Prophets.810Even though they had witnessed signs and miracles.811Like the angels.  Rather, they were human beings with human attributes.812Once they had conveyed the message.813This implies the honor of having been mentioned or addressed.  Another 
meaning is "your reminder. "

S´rah 21–al-AnbiyŒÕ JuzÕ 17
30811.And how many a city which was unjust814have We shattered 
and produced after it another people.
12.And when they [i.e., its inhabitants] perceived Our punishment,
at once they fled from it.
13.[Some angels said], "Do not flee but return to where you 
were given luxury and to your homes –perhaps you will be 
questioned. "815
14.They said, "O woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers."
15.And that declaration of theirs did not cease until We made 
them [as] a harvest [mowed down], extinguished [like a fire].
16.And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between 
them in play.
17.Had We intended to take a diversion,816We could have taken 
it from [what is] with Us –if [indeed] We were to do so.
18.Rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it,817
and thereupon it departs.  And for you is destruction from that 
which you describe.818
19.To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth.  And 
those near Him [i.e., the angels] are not prevented by arrogance
from His worship, nor do they tire.
20.They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.
21.Or have they [i.e., men] taken for themselves gods from the 
earth who resurrect [the dead]?
22.Had there been within them [i.e., the heavens and earth] gods 
besides AllŒh, they both would have been ruined.  So exalted 
is All Œh, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.
23.He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be 
questioned.
                                               
814i.e., its inhabitants persisting in wrongdoing.815About what happened to you.  This is said to them in sarcasm and ridicule.816Such as a wife or a child.817Literally, "strikes its brain," disabling or killing it.818Of untruth concerning AllŒh, particularly here, the claim that He has a 
son or other "partner" in divinity.

S´rah 21–al-AnbiyŒÕ JuzÕ 17
30924.Or have they taken gods besides Him?  Say, [O Muúammad ], 
"Produce your proof.  This [QurÕ Œn] is the message for those 
with me and the message of those before me."819  But most of 
them do not know t he truth, so they are turning away.
25.And We sent not before you any messenger except that We 
revealed to him that, "There is no deity except Me, so worship 
Me."
26.And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken a son."  Exalted 
is He!  Rather, they820are [b ut] honored servants.
27.They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command.
28.He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be 
after them,821and they cannot intercede except on behalf of 
one whom He approves.  And they, from fear of Him, are 
apprehensive.
29.And whoever of them should say, "Indeed, I am a god besides 
Him" –that one We would recompense with Hell.  Thus do 
We recompense the wrongdoers.
30.Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens 
and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and 
made from water every living thing?  Then will they not believe?
31.And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it
should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes
[as] roads that they mi ght be guided.
32.And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its 
signs,822are turning away.
33.And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun 
and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.
                                               
819All previous prophets called for the worship of All Œh alone.820Those they claim to be "children" of AllŒh, such as the angels, Ezra, 
Jesus, etc.821See footnote to 2:255 .822The signs present in the heavens.

31034.And We did not grant t o any man before you eternity [on earth];
so if you die –would they be eternal?
35.Every soul will taste death.  And We test you with evil and 
with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.
36.And when those who disbelieve see you, [O Muúammad ], 
they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], "Is this the one 
who mentions [i.e., insults] your gods?"  And they are, at the 
mention of the Most Merciful, disbelievers.
37.Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience].  I will show you 
My signs [i.e., veng eance], so do not impatiently urge Me.
38.And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
39.If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not 
avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs and they 
will not be aided...823
40.Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, 
and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.
41.And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those 
who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicul e.
42.Say, "Who can protect you at night or by day from the Most 
Merciful?"  But they are, from the remembrance of their Lord, 
turning away.
43.Or do they have gods to defend them other than Us?  They are 
unable [even] to help themselves, nor can they beprotected 
from Us.
44.But, [on the contrary], We have provided good things for these 
[disbelievers] and their fathers until life was prolonged for them.   
Then do they not see that We set upon the land, reducing it from
its borders?824  Is it they who will overcome?
45.Say, "I only warn you by revelation."  But the deaf do not hear 
the call when they are warned.
                                               
823The completion of the sentence is understood to be "...they would not be 
asking in disbelief and ridicule to be shown the punishment."824See footnote to 13:41 .

31146.And if [as much as] a whiff of the punishment of your Lord 
should touch them, they would surely say, "O woe to us!  
Indeed, we have been wrongd oers."
47.And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, 
so no soul will be treated unjustly at all.  And if there is [even] 
the weight of a mustard seed,825We will bring it forth.  And 
sufficient are We as accountant.
48.And We had alrea dy given Moses and Aaron the criterion and 
a light and a reminder826for the righteous
49.Who fear their Lord unseen,827while they are of the Hour 
apprehensive.
50.And this [QurÕ Œn] is a blessed message which We have sent 
down.  Then are you with it unacqua inted?828
51.And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement 
before,829and We were of him well -Knowing
52.When he said to his father and his people, "What are these 
statues to which you are devoted?"
53.They said, "We found our fathers worshippers o f them."
54.He said, "You were certainly, you and your fathers, in manifest
error."
55.They said, "Have you come to us with truth, or are you of 
those who jest?"
56.He said, "[No], rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens 
and the earth who created them, and I, to that, am of those 
who testify.
57.And [I swear] by AllŒh, I will surely plan against your idols 
after you have turned and gone away."
                                               
825i.e., anything as small or insignificant as a mustard seed.826These are three qual ities of the Torah.827Which can mean "Him being unseen" by them or "though they are unseen"
by others.828i.e., pretending ignorance, disapproving or refusing to acknowledge it?829i.e., before Moses.  All Œh had guided him from early youth.

S´rah 21–al-AnbiyŒÕ JuzÕ 17
31258.So he made them into fragments, except a large one among them,
that they might return to it [and quest ion].
59.They said, "Who has done this to our gods?  Indeed, he is of 
the wrongdoers."
60.They said, "We heard a young man mention them who is called
Abraham."
61.They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people that 
they may testify."830
62.They said, "Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?"
63.He said, "Rather, this –the largest of them –did it, so ask them,
if they should [be able to] speak."
64.So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said [to each other],
"Indeed, you are the wron gdoers."
65.Then they reversed themselves,831[saying], "You have already 
known that these do not speak!"
66.He said, "Then do you worship instead of AllŒh that which 
does not benefit you at all or harm you?
67.Uff832to you and to what you worship instead of All Œh.  Then 
will you not use reason?"
68.They said, "Burn him and support your gods –if you are to act."
69.We [i.e., AllŒh] said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon 
Abraham."
70.And they intended for him a plan [i.e., harm], but We made 
them the greatest losers.
71.And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had 
blessed for the worlds [i.e., peoples].
                                               
830To what they had heard him say.  It may also mean "...that they may 
witness [what will be done to him as punishment]."831After first admitting their error, they were seized by pride and obstinacy.832An exclamation of anger and displeasure.

31372.And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in addition, and all [of them]
We made righteous.
73.And We made them leaders guiding by Our command.  And We 
inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of 
prayer, and giving of zakŒh; and they were worshippers of Us.
74.And to Lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We saved 
him from the city that was committing wicked deeds.  Indeed, 
they w ere a people of evil, defiantly disobedient.
75.And We admitted him into Our mercy.  Indeed, he was of the 
righteous.
76.And [mention] Noah, when he called [to All Œh]833before [that 
time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family 
from the great affliction [i.e., the flood].
77.And We aided [i.e., saved] him from the people who denied 
Our signs.  Indeed, they were a people of evil, so We drowned 
them, all together.
78.And [mention] David and Solomon, when they judged concerning
the field –when the sheep of a people overran it [at night],834
and We were witness to their judgement.
79.And We gave understanding of it [i.e., the case] to Solomon, 
and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge.  
And We subjected the mountains to exalt [Us], along with 
David and [also] the birds.  And We were doing [that].835
80.And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect 
you from your [enemy in] battle.  So will you then be grateful?
81.And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing forcefull y, 
proceeding by his command toward the land which We had 
blessed.  And We are ever, of all things, Knowing.
                                               
833i.e., supplicated against his people who had persisted in denial and animosity.   
See 71:26 -28.834Eating and destroying the crops.835Meaning that AllŒh has always been capable of accomplishing whatever 
He wills.

S´rah 21–al-AnbiyŒÕ JuzÕ 17
31482.And of the devils [i.e., jinn] were those who dived for him and 
did work other than that.  And We were of them a guardian.836
83.And [mention] J ob, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity
has touched me, and You are the most merciful of the merciful."
84.So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of 
adversity.  And We gave him [back] his family and the like 
thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the 
worshippers [of All Œh].
85.And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul -Kifl; all were of 
the patient.
86.And We admitted them into Our mercy.  Indeed, they were of 
the righteous.
87.And [mention] the man of the fish [i.e., Jonah], when he went off
in anger837and thought that We would not decree [anything] 
upon him.838  And he called out within the darknesses,839
"There is no deity except You; exalted are You.  Indeed, I have
been of the wrongdoers."
88.So We responded to him and saved him from the distress.  
And thus do We save the believers.
89.And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, "My Lord,
do not leave me alone [with no heir], while You are the best of
inheritors."
90.So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and 
amended for him his wife.  Indeed, they used to hasten to good
deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us 
humbly submissive.
91.And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity [i.e., Mary], 
so We blew into her [garment] t hrough Our angel [i.e., Gabriel],
and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.
                                               
836Preventing any disobedience or deviation by them from Solomon's instructions
and p rotecting him from being harmed by them.837At the disbelief of his people.838Or "would not restrict him" in the belly of the fish.839That of the night, of the sea, and of the fish's interior.

31592.Indeed this, your religion, is one religion,840and I am your Lord,
so worship Me.
93.And [yet] they divided their affair [i.e., that of their religion] 
among themsel ves,841[but] all to Us will return.
94.So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer –no 
denial will there be for his effort,842and indeed We [i.e., Our 
angels], of it, are recorders.
95.And it is prohibit edto[the people of] a city which We have 
destroyed that they will [ever] return843
96.Until when [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and 
they, from every elevation, descend
97.And [when] the true promise [i.e., the resurrection] has 
approached; then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved 
will be staring [in horror, while they say], "O woe to us; we 
had been unmindful of this; rather, we were wrongdoers."
98.Indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than
AllŒh are the firewood of Hell.  You will be coming to [enter] i t.
99.Had these [false deities] been [actual] gods, they would not 
have come to it, but all are eternal therein.
100.For them therein is heavy sighing, and they therein will not hear.
101.Indeed, those for whom the best [reward] has preceded from 
Us –they are from it far removed.
102.They will not hear its sound, while they are, in that which their
souls desire, abiding eternally.
103.They will not be grieved by the greatest terror,844and the angels
will meet them, [saying], "This is your Day which you have 
been promised" –
                                               
840i.e., a collective way of life or course of conduct followed by a community.841Becoming sects and denominations.842Such a person will not be deprived of his due reward.843They cannot return to this world, nor can they repent to All Œh.844The events of the Last Hour or of the Resurrection.

316104.The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a 
[written] sheet for the records.  As We began the first creation, 
We will repeat it.  [That is] a promise binding upon Us.  Indeed,
We will do it.845
105.And We have alr eady written in the book [of Psalms ]846after the
[previous] mention847that the land [of Paradise] is inherited by
My righteous servants.
106.Indeed, in this [QurÕ Œn] is notification for a worshipping people.
107.And We have not sent you, [O Muúammad ], except as a mercy
to the worlds.
108.Say, "It is only revealed to me that your god is but one God; 
so will you be Muslims [in submission to Him]?"
109.But if they turn away, then say, "I have announced to [all of] 
you equally.848  And I know not whether near or far is that  
which you are promised.
110.Indeed, He knows what is declared of speech, and He knows 
what you conceal.
111.And I know not; perhaps it849is a trial for you and enjoyment 
for a time."
112.[The Prophet ()] has said, "My Lord, judge [between us] in 
truth.  And our Lord is the Most Merciful, the one whose help 
is sought against that which you describe."850
                                               
845More literally, "Indeed, We are ever doers" of what We will.846Az-Zab´r can also mean "scriptures" in general.847i.e., the Torah.  The "mention" may also refer to the original inscription 
with All Œh, i.e., the Preserved Slate ( al-Lawú al -Maúf´ th).848The Prophet () made this message known to all people, not concealing 
any of it from anyone or preferring any group over another.849The postponement of punishment.850i.e., their lies and disbelief.

BismillŒhir -RaúmŒnir -Raúeem
1.O mankind, fear your Lord.  Indeed, the convulsion of th e [final]
Hour is a terrible thing.
2.On the Day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted 
from that [child] she was nursing, and every pregnant woman 
will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people [appearing] 
intoxicated while they are not intoxicated; but the punishment 
of All Œh is severe.
3.And of the people is he who disputes about AllŒh without 
knowledge and follows every rebellious devil.
4.It has been decreed for him [i.e., every devil] that whoever turns 
to him –he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment
of the Blaze.
5.O people, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then 
[consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a 
sperm -drop, then from a clinging clot, and then from a lump of 
flesh, fo rmed and unformed852–that We may show you.853  And 
We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, 
then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] 
that you may reach your [time of] maturity.  And among you is 
he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is 
returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after 
[once having] knowledge, nothing.  And you see the earth barren,
but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and 
grows [something] of every beau tiful kind.
6.That is because AllŒh is the Truth and because He gives life to 
the dead and because He is over all things competent
                                               
851Al-îajj:  The Pilgrimage.852That which is incomplete.  This may include w hat is aborted at that stage.853Our power and creative ability.

3187.And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming –no doubt 
about it –and that All Œh will resurrect those in the graves .
8.And of the people is he who disputes about AllŒh without 
knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book [from Him],
9.Twisting his neck [in arrogance] to mislead [people] from the 
way of AllŒh.  For him in the world is disgrace, and We will 
make him taste on the Day of Resurrection the punishment of 
the Burning Fire [while it is said],
10."That is for what your hands have put forth and because All Œh 
is not ever unjust to [His] servants."
11.And of the people is he who worships All Œh on an edge.854  If 
he is touched by good, he is reassured by it; but if he is struck 
by trial, he turns on his face [to the other direction].  He has lost
[this] world and the Hereafter.  That is what is the manifest loss.
12.He invokes instead of All Œh that which neither harms him nor 
benefits him.  That is what is the extreme error.
13.He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit –how 
wretched the protector and how wretched the associate.
14.Indeed, AllŒh will admit those who believe and do righteous
deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow.  Indeed, All Œh does
what He intends.
15.Whoever should think that AllŒh will not support him [i.e., 
Prophet Muúammad ()] in this world and the Hereafter –let 
him extend a rope to the ceiling, then cut off [his breath],855
and let him see:  will his effort remove that which enrages [him]?
16.And thus have We sent it [i.e., the QurÕŒn] down as verses of 
clear evidence and because All Œh guides whom He intends.
17.Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews 
and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those 
who associated with AllŒh –AllŒh will judge between them 
                                               
854At the edge of his religion, so to speak, i.e., with uncertainty, hypocrisy 
or heedlessness.855i.e., strangle himself.

S´rah 22–al-îajj JuzÕ 17
319on the Day of Resurrection.  Indeed AllŒh is, over all things, 
Witness.
18.Do you not see [i.e., know] that to All Œh prostrates whoever is 
in the heavens and whoever is on the earth andthe sun, the 
moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures 
and many of the people?  But upon many the punishment has 
been justified.856  And he whom AllŒh humiliates –for him 
there is no bestow er of honor.  Indeed, AllŒh does what He 
wills.
19.These857are two adversaries who have disputed over their Lord.   
But those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments 
of fire.  Poured upon their heads will be scalding water
20.By which is melted that within their bellies and [their] skins.
21.And for [striking] them are maces of iron.
22.Every time they want to get out of it [i.e., Hellfire] from anguish,
they will be returned to it, and [it will be said], "Taste the 
punishment of the Burning F ire!"
23.Indeed, AllŒh will admit those who believe and do righteous 
deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow.  They will be adorned
therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and their garments therein
will be silk.
24.And they had been guided [in worldly life] to good speech, 
and they were guided to the path of the Praiseworthy.
25.Indeed, those who have disbelieved and avert [people] from 
the way of AllŒh and [from] al-Masjid al-îarŒm, which We 
made for the people –equal are the resident therein andone 
from outside –and [also] whoever intends [a deed] therein858
of deviation [in religion] or wrongdoing –We will make him 
taste of a painful punishment.
                                               
856And therefore decreed.857i.e., the believers and the disbelievers.858Whethe r inside its boundaries or intending from afar to do evil therein.  
The îaram is unique in that the mere intention of sin therein (whether or 
not it is actually carried out) is sufficient to bring punishment from All Œh.

32026.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when We designated for Abraham
the site of the House, [saying], "Do n ot associate anything with 
Me and purify My House for those who perform ‹awŒ f859and 
those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.
27.And proclaim to the people the úajj [pilgrimage]; they will 
come to you on foot and on every lean camel; the y will come 
from every distant pass –
28.That they may witness [i.e., attend] benefits for themselves 
and mention the name of All Œh on known [i.e., specific] days 
over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals.860  
So eat of them and feed the m iserable and poor.
29.Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and 
perform ‹awŒf around the ancient House."
30.That [has been commanded], and whoever honors the sacred 
ordinances of All Œh –it is best for him in the sight of his Lord.  
And permitted to you are the grazing livestock, except what is 
recited to you.861  So avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid
false statement,
31.Inclining [only] to All Œh, not associating [anything] with Him.  
And he who associates with AllŒh –it is as though he had 
fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind 
carried him down into a remote place.
32.That [is so].  And whoever honors the symbols [i.e., rites] of 
AllŒh –indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.
33.For you therein [i.e., the animals marked for sacrifice] are benefits
for a specified term;862then their place of sacrifice is at the 
ancient House.863
                                               
859See footnote to 2:125 .860Al-anÔŒm :  camels, cattle, sheep and goats.861See 5:3.862i.e., they may be milked or ridden (in the case of camels) before the time 
of slaughter.863i.e., within the boundaries of the îaram, which includes MinŒ.

32134.And for all religion We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice]864
that they may mention the name of AllŒh over what He has 
provide d for them of [sacrificial] animals.  For your god is 
one God, so to Him submit.  And, [O Muúammad ], give good 
tidings to the humble [before their Lord]
35.Who, when All Œh is mentioned, their hearts are fearful, and [to]
the patient over what has afflicte d them, and the establishers of 
prayer and those who spend from what We have provided them.
36.And the camels and cattle We have appointed for you as among
the symbols [i.e., rites] of AllŒh; for you therein is good.  So 
mention the name of AllŒh upon them when lined up [for 
sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat 
from them and feed the needy [who does not seek aid] and the 
beggar.  Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be 
grateful.
37.Their meat will not reach All Œh, nor will their blood, but what 
reaches Him is piety from you.  Thus have We subjected them 
to you that you may glorify AllŒh for that [to] which He has 
guided you; and give good tidings to the doers of good.
38.Indeed, All Œh defends those who have believed .  Indeed, AllŒh
does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful.
39.Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being 
fought,865because they were wronged.  And indeed, AllŒh is 
competent to give them victory.
40.[They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without
right –only because they say, "Our Lord is All Œh."  And were 
it not that AllŒh checks the people, some by means of others, 
there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, 
synagogues, and mosques in which the name of All Œh is much 
mentioned [i.e., praised].  And All Œh will surely support those 
who support Him [i.e., His cause].  Indeed, All Œh is Powerful 
and Exalted in Might.
                                               
864i.e., the right of sacrifice has always been a part of All Œh's revealed religion.865Referring here to the Prophet's companions.

32241.[And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land,
establish prayer and give zakŒh and enjoin what is right and
forbid what is wrong.  And to All Œh belongs the outcome of [all] 
matters.
42.And if they deny you, [O Muúammad ] –so, before them, did 
the people of Noah and ÔAad and Tham´d deny [their prophets],
43.And the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
44.And the inhabitants of Madyan.  And Moses was denied, so I 
prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers; then I seized them, 
and how [terrible] was My reproach.
45.And how many a city did We destroy while it was committing
wrong –so it is [now] fallen into ruin866–and [how many] an 
abandoned well and [how many] a lofty palace.867
46.So have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by 
which to reason and ears by which to hear?  For indeed, it is 
not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are 
within the breasts.
47.And they urge you to hasten the punishment.  But AllŒh will 
never fail in His promise.  And indeed, a day with your Lord 
is like a thousand years of those which you count.
48.And for ho w many a city did I prolong enjoyment while it was 
committing wrong.  Then I seized it, and to Me is the [final] 
destination.
49.Say, "O people, I am only to you a clear warner."
50.And those who have believed and done righteous deeds –for 
them is forgi veness and noble provision.
51.But the ones who strove against Our verses, [seeking] to cause 
failure868–those are the companions of Hellfire.
                                               
866Literally, "fallen in upon its roofs," i.e., after the roofs of its buildings had 
caved in, the walls collapsed over them.867i.e., How many wells have been left inoperative, and how many palaces 
have been emptied of their occupants in the past.868i.e., trying to undermine their credibility and thereby defeat the Prophet ().

S´rah 22–al-îajj JuzÕ 17
32352.And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet 
except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it 
[some misunderstanding].  But AllŒh abolishes that which 
Satan throws in; then All Œh makes precise His verses.869  And 
AllŒh is Knowing and Wise.
53.[That is] so He may make what Satan throws in [i.e., asserts] a 
trial for those within whose hearts is disease870and those hard 
of heart.  And indeed, the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension.
54.And so those who were given knowledge may know that it is 
the truth from your Lord and [therefore] believe in it, and their 
hearts humbly submit to it.  And ind eed is All Œh the Guide of 
those who have believed to a straight path.
55.But those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it 
until the Hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes 
to them the punishment of a barren Day.871
56.[All] sovereignty that Day is for AllŒh;872He will judge 
between them.  So they who believed and did righteous deeds 
will be in the Gardens of Pleasure.
57.And they who disbelieved and denied Our signs –for those 
there will be a humiliating punishment.
58.And those who e migrated for the cause of All Œh and then were 
killed or died –AllŒh will surely provide for them a good
provision.  And indeed, it is All Œh who is the best of providers.
59.He will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they 
will be pleased, a nd indeed, All Œh is Knowing and Forbearing.
60.That [is so].  And whoever responds [to injustice] with the 
equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is 
tyrannized –AllŒh will surely aid him.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
                                               
869Clarifying those issues which were misunderstood to remove any doubt.870See footnote to 2:10.871One which will not be followed by night and therefore will not give birth 
to a new day, referring to the Day of Resurrection.872None will compete with Him for authority at that time.

324Pardoning and Forgiving.873
61.That874is because AllŒh causes the night to enter the day and 
causes the day to enter the night and because All Œh is Hearing 
and Seeing.
62.That is because AllŒh is the Truth, and that which they call 
upon other than Him is falsehood, and because AllŒh is the 
Most High, the Grand.
63.Do you not see that All Œh has sent down rain from the sky and the 
earth becomes green?  Indeed, All Œh is Subtle and Acquainted .875
64.To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth.  
And indeed, All Œh is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.
65.Do you not see that All Œh has subjected to you whatever is on 
the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His 
command?  And He restrains the sky from falling upon the 
earth, unless by His permission.  Indeed AllŒh, to the people, 
is Kind and Merciful.
66.And He is the one who gave you life; then He causes you to 
die and then will [again] give you life.  Indeed, mankind is 
ungrateful.
67.For every religion We have appointed rites which they perform.   
So, [O Muúammad ], let them [i.e., the disbelievers] not contend
with you over the matter but invite them to your Lord.  Indeed,
you are upon straight guidance.
68.And if they dispute with you, then say, "All Œh is most knowing
of what you do.
69.AllŒh will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection 
concerning that over which you used to differ."
70.Do you not know that All Œh knows what is in the heaven and 
                                               
873In spite of His ability to take vengeance.  The statement contains a suggestion
that the believ ers pardon as well.874i.e., All Œh's capability to give assistance or victory to the oppressed.875With His creation and with the needs of His creatures.

325earth?  Indeed, that is in a Record.876  Indeed that, for All Œh, is 
easy.
71.And they worship besides All Œh that for which He has not sent 
down authority and that of which they have no knowledge.  
And there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper.
72.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disappro val.  
They are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to 
them Our verses.  Say, "Then shall I inform you of [what is] 
worse than that?877  [It is] the Fire which AllŒh has promised 
those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination."
73.O peo ple, an example is presented, so listen to it.  Indeed, those
you invoke besides All Œh will never create [as much as] a fly, 
even if they gathered together for it [i.e., that purpose].  And if 
the fly should steal from them a [tiny] thing, they could not 
recover it from him.  Weak are the pursuer and pursued.878
74.They have not appraised All Œh with true appraisal.879  Indeed, 
AllŒh is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
75.AllŒh chooses from the angels messengers and from the people.   
Indeed, All Œh is Hearing and Seeing.
76.He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be 
after them.880  And to All Œh will be returned [all] matters.
77.O you who have believed, bow and prostrate and worship 
your Lord and do good –that you may succeed.
78.And strive for AllŒh with the striving due to Him.  He has 
chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any 
                                               
876The Preserved Slate ( al-Lawú al -Maúf´ th), which is with All Œh.877i.e., worse than the rage you feel agains t those who recite AllŒh's verses 
or worse than your threats against them.878A comparison is made here to the worshipper of a false deity and that 
which he worships.879They have not assessed Him with the assessment due to Him, meaning 
that they did not take into account His perfect attributes.880See footnote to 2:255 .

AllŒh] named you "Muslims" before [in former scriptures] and 
in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over 
you and you may be witnesses over the people.  So establish 
prayer and give zakŒh and hold fast to All Œh.  He is your protector;
and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.

1.Certainly will the believers have succeeded:
2.They who are during their prayer humbly submissive
3.And they who turn away from ill speech
4.And they who are observant of zakŒh
5.And they who guard their private parts
6.Except from their wives or those their right hands possess,882
for indeed, they will not be blamed –
7.But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors –
8.And they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive
9.And they who carefu lly maintain their prayers –
10.Those are the inheritors
11.Who will inherit al -Firdaus.883  They will abide therein eternally.
12.And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.
13.Then We placed him as a sperm -drop884in a firm lodging [i.e., 
the womb].
14.Then We made the sperm -drop into a clinging clot, and We 
made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the 
lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We 
developed him into another creation.  So blessed is All Œh, the 
best of creators.885
15.Then indeed, after that you are to die.
16.Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected.

32817.And We have created above you seven layered heavens, and 
never have We been of [Our] creation unaware.
18.And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured 
amount and settled it in the earth.  And indeed, We are Able to 
take it away.
19.And We brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees 
and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from 
which you eat.
20.And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which
produces oil and food [i.e., olives] for those who eat.
21.And indeed, for you in livestock is a lesson.  We give you drink
from that which is in their bellies, and for you in them are 
numero us benefits, and from them you eat.
22.And upon them and on ships you are carried.
23.And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, "O 
my people, worship All Œh; you have no deity other than Him; 
then will you not fear H im?"
24.But the emine nt among those who disbelieved from his people 
said, "This is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to 
take precedence over you; and if AllŒh had willed [to send a 
messenger], He would have sent down angels.  We have not 
heard of this among our forefath ers.
25.He is not but a man possessed with madness, so wait concerning
him for a time."
26.[Noah] said, "My Lord, support me because they have denied 
me."
27.So We inspired to him, "Construct the ship under Our observation
and Our inspiration, and when Our command comes and the ove n
overflows,886put into it [i.e., the ship] from each [creature] two
mates and your family, except those for whom the decree [of 
destruction] has proceeded.  And do not address Me concerning
those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.

then say, 'Praise to AllŒh who has saved us from the wrongdoing
people.'
29.And say, 'My Lord, let me land at a blessed landing place, and 
You are the best to accommodate [ us].'"
30.Indeed in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever testing [Our 
servants].
31.Then We produced after them a generation of others.
32.And We sent among them a messenger887from themselves, 
[saying], "Worship AllŒh; you have no deity other than Him; 
then will you not fear Him ?"
33.And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied
the meeting of the Hereafter while We had given them luxury 
in the worldly life said, "This is not but a man like yourselves.  
He eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink.
34.And if you should obey a man like yourselves, indeed, you would
then be losers.
35.Does he promise you that when you have died and become 
dust and bones that you will be brought forth [once more]?
36.How far, how far, i s that which you are promised.888
37.It [i.e., life] is not but our worldly life –we die and live, but 
we will not be resurrected.
38.He is not but a man who has invented a lie about AllŒh, and 
we will not believe him."
39.He said, "My Lord, support me b ecause they have denied me."
40.[AllŒh] said, "After a little, they will surely become regretful."
41.So the shriek889seized them in truth,890and We made them as 
[plant] stubble.  Then away with the wrongdoing people.

33042.Then We produced after them other generations.
43.No nation will precede its time [of termination], nor will they 
remain [thereafter].
44.Then We sent Our messengers in succession.  Every time there
came to a nation its messenger, they denied him, so We made 
them follow one another [to d estruction], and We made them 
narrations.891  So away with a people who do not believe.
45.Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs 
and a clear authority
46.To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were arrogant and 
were a haughty people.
47.They said, "Should we believe two men like ourselves while 
their people are for us in servitude?"
48.So they denied them and were of those destroyed.
49.And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture that perhaps the y892
would be guided.
50.And We made theson of Mary and his mother a sign and 
sheltered them within a high ground having level [areas] and 
flowing water.
51.[AllŒh said], "O messengers, eat from the good foods and work
righteousness.  Indeed I, of what you do, am Knowing.
52.And indeed this, your religion, is on e religion,893and I am 
your Lord, so fear Me."
53.But they [i.e., the people] divided their religion among them into 
portions [i.e., sects] –each faction, in what it has,894rejoicing.
54.So leave them in their confusion for a time.
55.Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children

not perceive.895
57.Indeed, they who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord
58.And they who believe in the signs of their Lord
59.And they who do not associate anything with their Lord
60.And they who give what they give while their hearts are 
fearful896because they will be returning to their Lord –
61.It is those who hasten to good deeds, and they outstrip [others] 
therein .
62.And We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity, 
and with Us is a record which speaks with truth; and they will 
not be wronged.
63.But their hearts are covered with confusion over this, and they 
have [evil] deeds besides that [i.e., disbelief] which they are 
doing,
64.Until when We seize their affluent ones with punishment,897at 
once they are crying [to All Œh] for help.
65.Do not cry out today.  Indeed, by Us you will not be helped.
66.My verses had already been recited to you, but you were turning
back on your heels
67.In arrogance regarding it,898conversing by night, speaking evil.
68.Then have they not reflected over the word [i.e., the QurÕŒn], 
or has there come to them that which had not come to their 
forefathers?
69.Or did they not know their Messenger, so they are toward him 
disacknowledging?
70.Or do they say, "In him is madness"?  Rather, he brought them 
the truth, but most of them, to the truth, are averse.
                                               
895That the good things given to them in this world are but a trial for them.896Lest their deeds not be acceptable.897In worldly life, before the punishment of the Hereafter.  Although general,
the description includes specifically the pun ishment of the Quraysh by famine.898The revelation.  Or "him," i.e., the Prophet ( ).

33271.But if the Truth [i.e., AllŒh] had followed their inclinations, 
the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have 
been ruined.  Rather, We have brought them their message,899
but they, from their message, are turning away.
72.Or do you, [O Muúammad ], ask them for payment?  But the 
reward of your Lord is best, and He is the best of providers.
73.And indeed, you invite them to a straight path.
74.But indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are 
deviating from the path.
75.And even if We gave them mercy and removed what was upon
them of affliction, they would persist in their transgression, 
wandering blindly.
76.And We had gripped them with suffering [as a warning], but
they did not yield to their Lord, nor did they humbly supplicate,
[and will continue thus]
77.Until when We have opened before them adoor of severe 
punishment, immediately they will be therein in despair.
78.And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and 
hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful.
79.And it is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and 
to Hi m you will be gathered.
80.And it is He who gives life and causes death, and His is the
alternation of the night and the day.  Then will you not reason?
81.Rather,900they say like what the former peoples said.
82.They said, "When we have died and become dust and bones, 
are we indeed to be resurrected?
83.We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before; 
this is not but legends of the former peoples."
84.Say, [O Muúammad ], "To whom belongs the earth and whoever
is in it, if you should know?"

89.They will say, "[All belongs] to AllŒh."  Say, "Then how are 
you deluded?"
90.Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.
91.AllŒh has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him 
any deity.  [If there had been], then each deity would have 
taken what it created, and some of them would have sought to 
overcome others.  Exalted is All Œh above what they describe 
[concerning Him].
92.[He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He 
above what they associate [with Him].
93.Say, [O Muúammad ], "My Lord, if You should show me that 
which they are promised,
94.My Lord, then do not place me among the wrongdoing people."
95.And indeed, We are Able to show you what We have promised
them.
96.Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil.  We are most 
knowing of what they describe.
97.And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements 
of the devils,
98.And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me."
99.[For such is the state of the disbelievers] until, when death 
comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back
100.That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind."901

334No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier
until the Day they are resurrected.
101.So when the Horn is blown, no relationship will there be among
them that Day, nor will they ask about one another.
102.And those whose scales are heavy [with good deeds] –it is 
they who are the successful.
103.But those whose scales are light –those are the ones who have 
lost their souls, [being] in Hell, abiding eternally.
104.The Fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut 
smiles.902
105.[It will be said], "Were not My verses recited to you and you 
used to deny them?"
106.They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and 
we were a people astray.
107.Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil],
we would i ndeed be wrongdoers."
108.He will say, "Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.
109.Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, 'Our Lord, 
we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and 
You are the best of the merciful.'
110.But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you 
forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.
111.Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient 
endurance –that they are the attainers [of success]."
112.[AllŒh] will say, "H ow long did you remain on earth in number 
of years?"
113.They will say, "We remained a day or part of a day; ask those 
who enumerate."
114.He will say, "You stayed not but a little –if only you had known.

335115.Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to 
Us you would not be returned?"
116.So exalted is All Œh, the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity 
except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne.
117.And whoever invokes besides All Œh another deity for which he 
has no proof –then his account i s only with his Lord.  Indeed,
the disbelievers will not succeed.
118.And, [O Muúammad ], say, "My Lord, forgive and have mercy,
and You are the best of the merciful."

1.[This is] a s´rah which We have sent down and made [that within 
it] obligatory and revealed therein verses of clear evidence that
you might remember.
2.The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual
intercourse904–lash each one of them with a hundred lashes,905
and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion [i.e., law] of 
AllŒh,906if you should believe in All Œh and the Last Day.  And 
let a group of the believers witness their punishment.
3.The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or 
polytheist, and none marri es her except a fornicator907or a 
polytheist, and that [i.e., marriage to such persons] has been made
unlawful to the believers.
4.And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce 
four witnesses –lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept 
from them testimony ever after.  And those are the defiantly 
disobedient,
5.Except for those who repent thereafter and reform, for indeed, 
AllŒh is Forgiving and Merciful.
6.And those who accuse their wives [of adultery] and have no 
witnesses except themsel ves –then the witness of one of them908
                                               
903An-N´r:  Light.904Either by voluntary confession of the offender or the testimony of four 
male witnesses to having actually seen the act take place.  Otherwise, 
there can be no conviction.905The ruling in this verse is applicable to unmarried fornicators.  Execu tion 
by stoning is confirmed in the sunnah for convicted adulterers.906i.e., Do not let sympathy for a guilty person move you to alter anything 
ordained by All Œh, for in His law is protection of society as a whole.907Included in this ruling is the adulterer as well.  Such persons cannot be 
married to believers unless they have repented and reformed.908The husbands who have been betrayed.

337[shall be] four testimonies [swearing] by All Œh that indeed, he 
is of the truthful.
7.And the fifth [oath will be] that the curse of AllŒh be upon 
him if he should be among the liars.
8.But it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four 
testimonies [swearing] by All Œh that indeed, he is of the liars.
9.And the fifth [oath will be] that the wrath of All Œh be upon her 
if he was of the truthful.
10.And if not for the favor of All Œh upon you and His mercy ...909
and because All Œh is Accepting of repentance and Wise.
11.Indeed, those who came with falsehoo d910are a group among you.   
Do not think it bad for you; rather, it is good for you.  For every 
person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from 
thesin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion 
thereo f911–for him is a great punishment [i.e., Hellfire].
12.Why, when you heard it, did not the believing men and believing
women think good of themselves [i.e., one another] and say, 
"This is an ob vious falsehood"?
13.Why did they [who slandered] not produce for it four witnesses?   
And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, 
in the sight of All Œh, who are the liars.
14.And if it had not been for the favor of All Œh upon you and His
mercy in this world and the Hereafter, you would have been 
touched for that [lie] in which you were involved by a great 
punishment
15.When you received it with your tongues912and said with your 
                                               
909The phrase omitted is estimated to be "...you would have surely been 
punished, destroyed or scandalized," or "...you would have suffered many 
difficult situations."910Referring to the incident when the Prophet's wife ÔÕishah was falsely 
accused by the hypocrites.911i.e., ÔAbdullŒh bin ÔUbayy, leader of the hypocrites.912Rather than your ears, i.e., not thinking about what you had heard but 
hastening to repeat it carelessly.

S´rah 24–an-N´r JuzÕ 18
338mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it 
was insignificant while it was, in the sight of All Œh, tremendous.
16.And why, when you heard it, did you not say, "It is not for us to 
speak of this.  Exalted are You, [O All Œh]; this is a great slander"?
17.AllŒh warns you against returning to the likes of this [conduct],
ever, if you should be believers.
18.And All Œh makes clear to you the verses [i.e., His rulings], and
AllŒh is Knowing and Wise.
19.Indeed, those who like that immorality913should be spread [or 
publicized] among those who have believed wi ll have a painful
punishment in this world and the Hereafter.  And AllŒh knows914
and you do not know.
20.And if it had not been for the favor of All Œh upon you and His 
mercy...915and because All Œh is Kind and Merciful.
21.O you who have believed, do not fo llow the footsteps of Satan.   
And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan –indeed, he enjoins
immorality and wrongdoing.  And if not for the favor of All Œh
upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure,
ever, but AllŒh purifies whom He wills, and AllŒh is Hearing 
and Knowing.
22.And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to 
give [aid] to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants 
for the cause of AllŒh, and let them pardon and overlook.  
Would you not like that All Œh shou ld forgive you?  And All Œh 
is Forgiving and Merciful.
23.Indeed, those who [falsely] accuse chaste, unaware and believing
women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they 
will have a great punishment
24.On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will 
bear witness against them as to what they used to do.

33925.That Day, All Œh will pay them in full their true [i.e., deserved] 
recompense, and they will know that it is All Œh who is the 
manifest Truth [i.e., perfect in justice].
26.Evil w ords are for evil men, and evil men are [subjected] to 
evil words.  And good words are for good men, and good men 
are [an object] of good words.916  Those [good people] are 
declared innocent of what they [i.e., slanderers] say.  For them 
is forgiveness and n oble provision.
27.O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your 
own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet917their 
inhabitants.  That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded
[i.e., advised].
28.And if you do not find anyone the rein, do not enter them until 
permission has been given you.  And if it is said to you, "Go 
back,"918then go back; it is purer for you.  And All Œh is Knowing 
of what you do.
29.There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited 
in which there is convenience919for you.  And AllŒh knows 
what you reveal and what you conceal.
30.Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision920and 
guard their private parts.921  That is purer for them.  Indeed, 
AllŒh is Acquainted with what they do.
31.And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision922
and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment923
                                               
916Another accepted interpretation is "Evil women are for evil men, and evil 
men are for evil women.  And good women are for good men, and good 
men are for good women."917By the words " As-salŒmu Ôalaykum " ("Peace be upon you").918Or a similar expression showing that the occupants are not prepared to 
receive visitors (which should be respected).919Some benefit such as rest, shelter, commodities, one's personal belong ings, etc.920Looking only at what is lawful and averting their eyes from what is unlawful.921From being seen and from unlawful acts.922Looking only at what is lawful and averting their eyes from what is unlawful.923Both natural beauty, such as hair or body shape, and that with which a 
woman beautifies herself of clothing, jewelry, etc.

340except that which [necessarily] appears thereo f924and to wrap 
[a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose
their adornmen t [i.e., beauty] except to their husbands, their 
fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons,
their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their 
women, that which their right hands possess [i.e., slaves], or 
those male attendants having no physical desire,925or children 
who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.  And 
let them not stamp their feet to make known what they 
conceal of their adornment.  And turn to AllŒh in repentance, 
all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.
32.And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among
your male slaves and female slaves.  If they should be poor, All Œh 
will enrich them from His bounty, and All Œh is all -Encompassing
and Knowing.
33.But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain 
[from sexual relations] until All Œh enriches them from His bounty.   
And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] 
from among whom your right hands possess926–then make a 
contract with them if you know there is w ithin them goodness 
and give them from the wealth of AllŒh which He has given you.   
And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire
chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly 
life.  And if someone should compel them, then indeed, All Œh 
is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.
34.And We have certainly sent down to you distinct verses927and 
examples from those who passed on before you and an 
admonition for those who fear All Œh.
                                               
924i.e., the outer garments or whatever might appear out of necessity, such as 
a part of the face or the hands.925Referring to an abnormal condition in which a man is devoid of sexu al feeling.926i.e., those slaves who desire to purchase their freedom from their owners 
for a price agreed upon by both.927i.e., rulings and ordinances, in particular those in this s´rah.

Page 363:
S´rah 24–an-N´r JuzÕ 18
34135.AllŒh is the Light928of the heavens and the earth.  The example
of His light929is like a niche within which is a lamp;930the 
lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star 
lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor 
ofthe west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched 
by fire.  Light upon light.  All Œh guides to His light whom He 
wills.  And All Œh presents examples for the people, and All Œh 
is Knowing of all things.
36.[Such niches are] in houses [i.e., mosques] which AllŒh has 
ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned [i.e., 
praised] therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and 
the evenings931
37.[Are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the 
remembrance of AllŒh and performance of prayer and giving 
of zakŒh.  They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will 
[fearfully] turn about –
38.That AllŒh may reward them [according to] the best of what 
they did and increase them from His bounty.  And All Œh gives 
provision to whom He wills without account [i.e., limit].
39.But those who disbelieved –their deeds are like a mirage in a 
lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he 
comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds AllŒh before him, 
and He will pay him in full his due; and All Œh is s wift in account.
40.Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which
is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are 
clouds –darknesses, some of them upon others.  When one 
puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it.  And he to 
whom All Œh has not granted light –for him there is no light.
41.Do you not see that AllŒh is exalted by whomever is within 
                                               
928i.e., the source and bestower of light and enlightenment.929His guidan ce in the heart of a believing servant.930Literally, "a burning wick," which is the essence of a lamp.931The term used here can refer to either afternoon or evening.

342the heavens and the earth and [by] the birds with wings spread 
[in flight]?  Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer 
and exalting [Him], and All Œh is Knowing of what they do.
42.And to All Œh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth,
and to All Œh is the destination.
43.Do you not see that AllŒh drives clouds?  Then He brings 
them together; then He makes them into a mass, and you see 
the rain emerge from within it.  And He sends down from the 
sky, mountains [of clouds] within which is hail, and He strikes 
with it whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills.  The 
flash of its lightening almost takes away the eyes ight.
44.AllŒh alternates the night and the day.  Indeed in that is a lesson
for those who have vision.
45.AllŒh has created every [living] creature from water.  And of 
them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those 
that walk on two leg s, and of them are those that walk on four.  
AllŒh creates what He wills.  Indeed, AllŒh is over all things 
competent.
46.We have certainly sent down distinct verses.  And All Œh guides
whom He wills to a straight path.
47.But they [i.e., the hypocrites] say, "We have believed in All Œh 
and in the Messenger, and we obey"; then a party of them turns
away after that.  And those are not believers.
48.And when they are called to [the words of] AllŒh and His 
Messenger to judge between them, at once a party of them 
turns aside [in refusal].
49.But if the right is theirs, they come to him in prompt obedience.
50.Is there disease in their hearts?  Or have they doubted?  Or do 
they fear that All Œh will be unjust to them, or His Messenger?  
Rather, it is they who a re the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].
51.The only statement of the [true] believers when they are called 
to All Œh and His Messenger to judge between them is that they
say, "We hear and we obey."  And those are the successful.

Page 365:
S´rah 24–an-N´r JuzÕ 18
34352.And whoever obeys All Œh and His Messenger and fears All Œh 
and is conscious of Him –it is those who are the attainers.
53.And they swear by AllŒh their strongest oaths that if you 
ordered them, they would go forth [in AllŒh's cause].  Say, 
"Do not swear.  [Such] obedience is know n.932  Indeed, All Œh 
is Acquainted with that which you do."
54.Say, "Obey AllŒh and obey the Messenger; but if you turn 
away –then upon him is only that [duty] with which he has 
been charged, and upon you is that with which you have been 
charged.  And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided.  
And there is not upon the Messenger except the [responsibility 
for] clear notification."
55.AllŒh has promised those who have believed among you and done
righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to 
authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before 
them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their 
religion which He has preferred for them and that He will 
surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they 
worship Me, not associating anything with Me.  But whoever 
disbelieve s933after that –then those are the defiantly disobedient.
56.And establish prayer and give zakŒh and obey the Messenger –
that you may receive mercy.
57.Never think that the disbeliev ers are causing failure [to All Œh] 
upon the earth.  Their refuge will be the Fire –and how wretched
the destination.
58.O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands 
possess and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among 
you ask permission of you [before entering] at three times:  
before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing 
[for rest] at noon and after the night prayer.  [These are] three 
times of privac y934for you.  There is no blame upon you nor upon
                                               
932i.e., the hypocrites' pretense of obedience is known to be a lie.933i.e., denies the favor o f AllŒh or does not live by His ordinance.934Literally, "exposure" or "being uncovered."

Page 366:
S´rah 24–an-N´r JuzÕ 18
344them beyond these [peri ods], for they continually circulate among 
you –some of you, among others.  Thus does All Œh make clear
to you the verses [i.e., His ordinances]; and All Œh is Knowing 
and Wise.
59.And when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask 
permission [at all times] as those before them have done.  
Thus does AllŒh make clear to you His verses; and AllŒh is 
Knowing and Wise.
60.And women of post-menstrual age who have no desire for 
marriage –there is no blame upon them for putting aside their 
outer garment s [but] not displaying adornment.  But to modestly
refrain [from that] is better for them.  And AllŒh is Hearing 
and Knowing.
61.There is not upon the blind [any] constraint nor upon the lame 
constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when
you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers 
or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers 
or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father's 
brothers or the houses of your father's sisters or the houses of 
your mother's brothers or the houses of your mother's sisters 
or [from houses] whose keys you possess or [from the house] 
of your friend.  There is no blame upon you whether you eat 
together or separately.  But when you enter houses, give greetings
of peace935upon each other –a greeting from AllŒh, blessed 
and good.  Thus does AllŒh make clear to you the verses [of 
ordinance] that you may understand.
62.The believers are only those who believe in AllŒh and His 
Messenger and, when they are [meeting] with him for a matter 
of common interest, do not depart until they have asked his 
permission.  Indeed, those who ask your permission, [O 
Muúammad ] –those are the ones who believe in AllŒh and 
His Messenger.  So when they ask your permission for 
something of their affairs, then give permission to whom you 
                                               
935Saying, " As-salŒmu Ôalaykum " ("Peace be upon you").

345will among them and ask forgiveness for them of All Œh.  Indeed,
AllŒh is Forgiving and Merciful.
63.Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves
as the call of one of you to another.  Already AllŒh know s 
those of you who slip away, concealed by others.  So let those 
beware who dissent from his [i.e., the Prophet's] order,936lest 
fitnah937strike them or a painful punishment.
64.Unquestionably, to AllŒh belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and earth.  Already He knows that upon which you [stand]938
and [knows] the Day939when they will be returned to Him and 
He will inform them of what they have done.  And AllŒh is 
Knowing of all things.
                                               
936Meaning also his way or his sunnah.937Trials, affliction, dissension, strife, etc.938i.e., your position –the basis for your actions (whether sincere faith or 
hypocrisy) and the condition of your souls.939The meaning can also be rendered "...and [let them beware of] the Day..."

34710.Blessed is He who, if He willed, could have made for you 
[something] better than that –gardens beneath which rivers 
flow –and could make for you palace s.
11.But they have denied the Hour, and We have prepared for those
who deny the Hour a Blaze.
12.When it [i.e., the Hellfire] sees them from a distant place, they 
will hear its fury and roaring.
13.And when they are thrown into a narrow place therein bound 
in chains, they will cry out thereupon for destruction.
14.[They will be told], "Do not cry this Day for one destruction 
but cry for much destruction."
15.Say, "Is that better or the Garden of Eternity which is promised
to the righteous?  It will be for them a reward and destination.
16.For them therein is whatever they wish, [while] abiding eternally.   
It is ever upon your Lord a promise [worthy to be] requested .942
17.And [mention] the Day He will gather them and that which they 
worship besides AllŒh and will say, "Did you mislead these, 
My servants, or did they [themselves] stray from the way?"
18.They will say, "Exalted are You!  It was not for us to take 
besides You any allies [i.e., protectors].  But You provided 
comforts for them and their fat hers until they forgot the message
and became a people ruined."
19.So they will deny you, [disbelievers], in what you say,943and 
you cannot avert [punishment] or [find] help.  And whoever 
commits injustice944among you –We will make him taste a 
great punish ment.
20.And We did not send before you, [O Muúammad ], any of the 
messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets.   
And We have made some of you [people] as trial for others –
will you have patience?  And ever is your Lord, Seeing.
                                               
942Or "...a promise requested [for them by the angels]."943At the time of Judgement the false objects of worship will betray their 
worshippers and deny them.944Specifically, association of others with All Œh.

34821.And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, "Why 
were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our 
Lord?"  They have certainly become arrogant within themselves945
and [become] insolent with great insolence.
22.The day they see the angels946–no good tidings will there 
be that day for the criminals, and [the angels] will say, 
"Prevented and inaccessible."947
23.And We will approach [i.e., regard]948what they have done of 
deeds and make them as dust dispersed.
24.The companions of Paradise, that Day, are [in] a better settlement
and better resting place.
25.And [mention] the Day when the heaven will split open with 
[emerging] clouds,949and the angels will be sent down in 
successive descent.
26.True sovereignty, that Day, is for the Most Merci ful.  And it 
will be upon the disbelievers a difficult Day.
27.And the Day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands [in regret] 
he will say, "Oh, I wish I had taken with the Messenger a way .950
28.Oh, woe to me!  I wish I had not taken that one951as a friend.
29.He led me away from the remembrance952after it had come to 
me.  And ever is Satan, to man, a deserter."953
30.And the Messenger has said, "O my Lord, indeed my people 
have taken this QurÕ Œn as [a thing] abandoned."954
                                               
945Additional meanings are "among themselves" and "over [the matter of] 
themselves."946i.e., at the time of death.947Referring to any good tidings.948On the Day of Judgement.949Within which are the angels.950i.e., followed the Prophet ( ) on a path of guidance.951The person who misguided him.952i.e., the QurÕ Œn or the remembrance of All Œh.953Forsaking him once he has led him into evil.954i.e., avoiding it, not listening to or understanding it, not living by it, or 
preferring something else to it.

34931.And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from 
among the criminals.  But sufficient is your Lord as a guide and
a helper.
32.And those who disbelieve say, "Why was the QurÕ Œn not revealed
to him all at once?"  Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby
your heart.  And We have spac ed it distinctly.955
33.And they do not come to you with an example [i.e., argument] 
except that We bring you the truth and the best explanation.
34.The ones who are gathered on their faces to Hell –those are 
the worst in position and farthest astray in [ their] way.
35.And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture and appointed
with him his brother Aaron as an assistant.
36.And We said, "Go both of you to the people who have denied 
Our signs."  Then We destroyed them with [complete] destruction.
37.And the people of Noah –when they denied the messengers ,956
We drowned them, and We made them for mankind a sign.  
And We have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment.
38.And [We destroyed] ÔAad and Tham´d and the companions of 
the well957and many gen erations between them.
39.And for each We presented examples [as warnings], and each 
We destroyed with [total] destruction.
40.And they have already come upon the town which was showered
with a rain of evil [i.e., stones].  So have they not seen it?  But
they are not expecting resurrection.958
41.And when they see you, [O Muúammad ], they take you not 
except in ridicule, [saying], "Is this the one whom AllŒh has 
sent as a messenger?
                                               
955Also, "recited it with distinct recitation."956Their denial of Noah was as if they had denied all those who brought the 
same message from All Œh.957Said to be a people who denied Prophet ShuÔayb or possibly those 
mentioned in S´rah YŒ Seen, 36:13 -29.958So they do not benefit from lessons of the past.

35042.He almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been 
steadfast in [worship of] them."  But they are going to know, 
when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in [his] way.
43.Have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire?  
Then would you be responsible for him?
44.Or do you think that most of t hem hear or reason?  They are not 
except like livestock.959  Rather, they are [even] more astray in
[their] way.
45.Have you not considered your Lord –how He extends the 
shadow, and if He willed, He could have made it stationary?  
Then We made the sun for it an indication.960
46.Then We hold it in hand for a brief grasp.961
47.And it is He who has made the night for you as clothing962and 
sleep [a means for] rest and has made the day a resurrection .963
48.And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His 
mercy [i.e., rainfall], and We send down from the sky pure water
49.That We may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as 
drink to those We created of numerous livestock and men.
50.And We have certainly distributed it among them that they 
migh t be reminded,964but most of the people refuse except 
disbelief.
51.And if We had willed, We could have sent into every city a 
warner.965
52.So do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them with 
it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] a great striving.
                                               
959i.e., cattle or sheep, that follow without question wherever they are led.960i.e., showing the existence of a shadow or making it apparent by contrast.961i.e., when the s un is overhead at noon.962Covering and concealing you in its darkness.963For renewal of life and activity.964Of All Œh's ability to bring the dead to life.965However, All Œh willed that Prophet Muúammad ()be sent as the final 
messenger for all peoples of the e arth until the Day of Resurrection.

35153.And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas 
[i.e., bodies of water], one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter,
and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.
54.And it is He who has created from water [i.e., semen] a human 
being and made him [a relative by] lineage and marriage.  
And ever is your Lord competent [concerning creation].
55.But they worship rather than All Œh that which does not benefit
them or harm them, and the disbeliever is ever, against his Lord, 
an assistant [t o Satan].
56.And We have not sent you, [O Muúammad ], except as a bringer
of good tidings and a warner.
57.Say, "I do not ask of you for it any payment –only that whoever
wills might take to his Lord a way."
58.And rely upon the Ever -Living who does notdie, and exalt 
[AllŒh] with His praise.  And sufficient is He to be, with the 
sins of His servants, Acquainted –
59.He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between 
them in six days and then established Himself above the 
Throne966–the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well 
informed [i.e., the Prophet ()].
60.And when it is said to them, "Prostrate to the Most Merciful," 
they say, "And what is the Most Merciful?  Should we prostrate
to that which you order us?"  And it increases them in aversion.
61.Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed 
therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon.
62.And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession 
for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude.
63.And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk 
upon the earth easily,967and when the ignorant address them 
[harshly], they say [words of] peace,968

35264.And those who spend [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating
and standing [in prayer]
65.And those who say, "Our Lord, avert from us the punishment 
of Hell.  Indeed, it s punishment is ever adhering;
66.Indeed, it is evil as a settlement and residence."
67.And [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excessively
or sparingly but are ever, between that, [justly] moderate
68.And those who do not invoke with All Œhanother deity or kill 
the soul which AllŒh has forbidden [to be killed], except by right,
and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse.  And whoever 
should do that will meet a penalty.
69.Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection,
and he will abide therein humiliated –
70.Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work.  
For them AllŒh will replace their evil deeds with good.  And 
ever is All Œh Forgiving and Merciful.
71.And he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn 
to All Œh with [accepted] repentance.

not fall upon them deaf and blind.

and offspring comfort to our eyes969and make us a leader [i.e., 
example] for the righteous."
75.Those will be awarded the Chamber970for what they patiently 
endured, and they will bereceived therein with greetings and 
[words of] peace,
76.Abiding eternally therein.  Good is the settlement and residence.

supplication?"971  For you [disbelievers] have denied, so it 
[i.e., your de nial] is going to be adherent.972
                                               
971i.e., faith and worship.  An alternative meaning is "What would my Lord

that they will not be believers.

sign for which their necks would remain humbled.975

the Most Merciful except that they turn away from it.
6.For they have already denied, but there w ill come to them the 
news of that which they used to ridicule.
7.Did they not look at the earth –how much We have produced 
therein from every noble kind?
8.Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.
9.And indeed, your Lord –He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
10.And [mention] when your Lord called Moses, [saying], "Go to 
the wrongdoing people –
11.The people of Pharaoh.  Will they not fear All Œh?"
12.He said, "My Lord, indeed I fear that they will deny me
13.And t hat my breast will tighten and my tongue will not be fluent,

35516.Go to Pharaoh and say, 'We are the messengers976of the Lord 
of the worlds,
17.[Commanded to say], "Send with us the Children of Israel. "'"
18.[Pharaoh] said, "Did we not raise you among us as a child, 
and you remained among us for years of your life?
19.And [then] you did your deed which you did,977and you were 
of the ungrateful."
20.[Moses] said, "I did it, then, while I was of those astray [i.e., 
ignorant].
21.So I fled from you when I feared you.  Then my Lord granted 
mejudgement [i.e., wisdom and prophethood] and appointed 
me [as one] of the messengers.
22.And is this a favor of which you remind me –that you have 
enslaved the Children of Israel?"
23.Said Pharaoh, "And what is the Lord of the worlds?"
24.[Moses] said, "The Lord of the heavens and earth and that 
between them, if you should be convinced."
25.[Pharaoh] said to those around him, "Do you not hear?"
26.[Moses] said, "Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers."
27.[Pharaoh] said,978"Indeed, your 'messenger' who has been sent 
toyou is mad."
28.[Moses] said, "Lord of the east and the west and that between 
them, if you were to reason."
29.[Pharaoh] said, "If you take a god other than me, I will surely 
place you among those imprisoned."
30.[Moses] said, "Even if I brought you something [i.e., proof] 
manifest?"

32.So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent 
manifest .979
33.And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white for the 
observers.
34.[Pharaoh] said to the eminent ones around him, "Indeed, this 
is a learned magician.
35.He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic, so what 
do you advise?"
36.They said, "Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and 
send among the cities gathere rs
37.Who will bring you every learned, skilled magician."
38.So the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a 
well-known day.980
39.And it was said to the people, "Will you congregate
40.That we might follow the magicians if they are the predomi nant?"
41.And when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Is 
there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?"
42.He said, "Yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to 
me]."
43.Moses said to them, "Throw whatever you will throw."
44.So they threw their ropes and their staffs and said, "By the 
might of Pharaoh, indeed it is we who are predominant."
45.Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it devoured what they 
falsified.
46.So the magicians fell down in prostration [to All Œh].
47.They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,
48.The Lord of Moses and Aaron."

35749.[Pharaoh] said, "You believed him [i.e., Moses] before I gave 
you permission.  Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you 
magic, but you are going to know.  I will surely cut off your 
hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify
you all."
50.They said, "No harm.  Indeed, to our Lord we will return.
51.Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because
we were the first of th e believers."
52.And We inspired to Moses, "Travel by night with My servants;
indeed, you will be pursued."
53.Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers981
54.[And said], "Indeed, those are but a small band,
55.And indeed, they are enraging us,
56.And indeed, we are a cautious society..."
57.So We removed them from gardens and springs
58.And treasures and honorable station982–
59.Thus.  And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel.
60.So they pursued them at sunrise.
61.And when the two comp anies saw one another, the companions
of Moses said, "Indeed, we are to be overtaken!"
62.[Moses] said, "No!  Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide
me."
63.Then We inspired to Moses, "Strike with your staff the sea," and 
it parted, and each portion w as like a great towering mountain.
64.And We advanced thereto the others [i.e., the pursuers].
65.And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.
66.Then We drowned the others.
                                               
981Recruiters of an army to prevent the emigration of the Children of Israel.982AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) caused them to abandon their wealth and

69.And recite to them the news of Abraham,
70.When he said to his father and his people, "What do you 
worship?"
71.They said, "We worship idols and remain to them devoted."
72.He said, "Do they hear you when you supplicate?
73.Or do they benefit you, or do they harm?"
74.They said, "But we found our fathers doing thus."
75.He said, "Then do you see what you have been worshipping,
76.You and your ancient forefathers?
77.Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds ,983
78.Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.
79.And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.
80.And when I am ill, it is He who cures me
81.And who will cause me to die and then bring me to l ife

of Recompense."

the righteous.
84.And grant me a mention [i.e., reputation] of honor among later 
generations.
85.And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.
86.And forgive my father.  Indeed, he has been of those astray.
87.And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected –
88.The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children
89.But only one who comes to All Œh with a sound heart."

92.And it will be said to them, "Where are those you used to worship
93.Other than All Œh?  Can they help you or help themselves?"
94.So they will be overturned into it [i.e., Hellfire], they and the 
deviators
95.And the soldiers of Iblees, all together.
96.They will say while they dispute therein,
97."By All Œh, we were indeed in manifest error
98.When we equated you with the Lord of the worlds.
99.And no one misguided us except the criminals.
100.So now we have no intercessors
101.And not a devoted friend.
102.Then if we only had a return [to the world] and could be of the 
believers..."984
103.Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.

105.The people of Noah denied the messengers985
106.When their brother Noah said to t hem, "Will you not fear All Œh?
107.Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger.

from the Lord of the worlds.
110.So fear All Œh and obey me."
111.They said, "Should we believe you while you are followed by 
the lowest [class of people]?"
112.He said, "And what is my knowledge of what they used to do?

those who are stoned."
117.He said, "My Lord, indeed my people have denied me.
118.Then judge between me and them with decisive judgement and
save me and those with me of the believers."
119.So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
120.Then We drowned thereafter the remaining ones.

that you might abide eternally?
130.And when you strike, you strike as tyrants.

147.Within gardens and springs
148.And fi elds of crops and palm trees with softened fruit?
149.And you carve out of the mountains, homes, with skill.
150.So fear All Œh and obey me.

152.Who cause corruption in the land and do not amend."
153.They said, "You are only of those affected by magic.

198.And even if We had revealed it to one among the foreigners991
199.And he had recited it to th em [perfectly],992they would [still]

6.And indeed, [O Muúammad ], you receive the QurÕ Œn from one 
Wise and Knowing.
7.[Mention] when Moses said to his family, "Indeed, I have 
perceived a fire.  I will bring you from there information or will
bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves."
8.But when he came to it, he was called, "Blessed is whoever is

9.O Moses, indeed it is I –AllŒh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."

Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient."
13.But when there came to them Our visible signs, they said, 
"This is obv ious magic."
14.And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced
thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness.  So see how was the 
end of the corrupters.
15.And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge,
and they said, "Praise [is due] to AllŒh, who has favored us 
over many of His believing servants."
16.And Solomon inherited David.  He said, "O people, we have 
been taught the language of birds, and we have been given 
from all things.  Indeed, this is evident bounty."
17.And gathered for Solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and 
men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows
18.Until, when they came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, 
"O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by 
Solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not."
19.So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, "My 
Lord, enable me1003to be grateful for Your favor which You 
have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do 
righteousness of which You approve.  And admit me by Your 
mercy i nto [the ranks of] Your righteous servants."1004

23.Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has bee n

24.I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of 
AllŒh, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and 
averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided,
25.[And] so they do not pro strate to All Œh, who brings forth what 
is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what 
you conceal and what you declare –
26.AllŒh –there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne."
27.[Solomon] said, "We will see whether you were truth ful or 
were of the liars.
28.Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them.  Then leave 
them and see what [answer] they will return."
29.She said, "O eminent ones, indeed, to me has been delivered a

Muslims]. '"
32.She said, "O eminent ones, advise me in my affair.  I would 
not decide a matter un til you witness [for] me."1005
33.They said, "We are men of strength and of great military might,

with wealth?  But what All Œh has given me is better than what 
Hehas given you.  Rather, it is you who rejoice in your gift.
37.Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers 
that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely 
expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased. "
38.[Solomon] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring
me her throne before they come to me in submission?"
39.A powerful one from among the jinn said, "I will bring it to 
you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this 
[task] stron g and trustworthy."
40.Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, "I will bring 
it to you before your glance returns to you."  And when 
[Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, "This is from the 
favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be gratef ul or 
ungrateful.  And whoever is grateful –his gratitude is only for 
[the benefit of] himself.  And whoever is un grateful –then 
indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous."
41.He said, "Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she
will be gui ded [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided."
42.So when she arrived, it was said [to her], "Is your throne like 
this?"  She said, "[It is] as though it was it."  [Solomon said], 
"And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been 
Muslims [ in submission to All Œh].
43.And that which she was worshipping other than AllŒh had 
averted her [from submission to Him].  Indeed, she was from 
a disbelieving people."
44.She was told, "Enter the palace."  But when she saw it, she 
thought it was a body o f water1006and uncovered her shins [to 
wade through].  He said, "Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is]
made smooth with glass."  She said, "My Lord, indeed I have 
wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to All Œh, Lord of 
the worlds."

37045.And We had certa inly sent to Tham´d their brother êŒliú, 
[saying], "Worship AllŒh," and at once they were two parties 
conflicting.
46.He said, "O my people, why are you impatient for evil before 
[i.e., instead of] good?1007  Why do you not seek forgiveness 
of All Œh that you may receive mercy?"
47.They said, "We consider you a bad omen, you and those with 
you."  He said, "Your omen [i.e., fate] is with All Œh.  Rather, 
you are a people being tested."1008
48.And there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption
in the land and not amending [its affairs].
49.They said, "Take a mutual oath by All Œh that we will kill him by 
night, he and his family.  Then we will say to his executor ,1009
'We did not witness the destruction of his family, and indeed, 
we are truthful. '"
50.And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they 
perceived not.
51.Then look how was the outcome of their plan –that We destroyed
them and their people, all.
52.So those are their houses, desolate because of the wrong they 
had done.  Indeed in t hat is a sign for people who know.
53.And We saved those who believed and used to fear All Œh.
54.And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit
immorality1010while you are seeing?1011
55.Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women?   
Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly."
                                               
1007By challenging êŒliú to bring on the promised punishment rather than 
asking for mercy from All Œh.1008Or "being tempted [by Satan]."1009i.e., the one responsible for executing his will and avenging his blood.1010Homosexual acts.1011i.e., openly.  Ano ther meaning is "...while you are aware [that it is wrong]."

37156.But the answer of his people was not except that they said, 
"Expel the family of Lot from your city.  Indeed, they are 
people who keep themselves pure."
57.So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We 
destined her to be of those who remained behind.
58.And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the 
rain of those who were warned.
59.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Praise be to All Œh, and peace upon His 
servants whom He has chosen.  Is AllŒh better or what they 
associate with Him?"
60.[More precisely], is He [not best] who created the heavens and 
the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, causing to 
grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not 
[otherwise] have grown the trees thereof?  Is there a deity with 
AllŒh?1012  [No], but they are a people who ascribe equals [to 
Him].
61.Is He [not best] who made the earth a stable ground and placed
within it rivers and made for it firmly set mountains and placed
between the two seas a barrier?  Is there a deity with AllŒh?  
[No], but most of them do not know.
62.Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he 
calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of 
the earth?1013  Is there a deity with AllŒh?  Little do you 
remember.
63.Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the 
land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before 
His mercy?  Is there a deity with All Œh?  High is All Œh above 
whatever they associate with Him.
64.Is He [not best] who begins creation and then repeats it and 
who provides for you from the heaven and earth?  Is there a 
                                               
1012Three meanings are implied:  "Is there another god who did all of this 
with All Œh?" or "Is there any deity worthy to be worshipped along with 
AllŒh?" or "Is there a deity to be compared with All Œh?"1013Generation after generation.

truthful."
65.Say, "None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except
AllŒh, and the y do not perceive when they will be resurrected."
66.Rather, their knowledge is arrested concerning the Hereafter.  
Rather, they are in doubt about it.  Rather, they are, concerning
it, blind.
67.And those who disbelieve say, "When we have become dust 
aswell as our forefathers, will we indeed be brought out [of 
the graves]?
68.We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before.  
This is not but legends of the former peoples."
69.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Proceed [i.e., travel] through the land 
and ob serve how was the end of the criminals."
70.And grieve not over them or be in distress from what they 
conspire.
71.And they say, "When is [the fulfillment of] this promise, if 
you should be truthful?"
72.Say, "Perhaps it is close behind you [i.e., very near] –some of 
that for which you are impatient.
73.And indeed, your Lord is full of bounty for the people, but 
most of them do not show gratitude."
74.And indeed, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and 
what they declare.
75.And there is nothin g concealed1014within the heaven and the 
earth except that it is in a clear Register.1015

that over which they disagree.

79.So rely upon All Œh; indeed, you are upon the clear truth.
80.Indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the 
deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating.
81.And you cannot guide the blind away from their error.  You 
will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they 
are Muslims [i.e., submitting to All Œh].
82.And when the word [i.e., decree] befalls them,1016We will 
bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to 
them, [saying] that the people were, of Our verses, not certain 
[in faith].
83.And [warn of] the Day when We will gather from every 
nation a company of those who deny Our signs, and they will 
be [driven] in rows
84.Until, when they arrive [at the place of Judgement], He will say, 
"Did you deny My signs while you encompassed them not in 
knowledge, or what [was it that] you were doing?"
85.And the decree will befall them1017for the wrong the y did, and 
they will not [be able to] speak.
86.Do they not see that We made the night that they may rest 
therein and the day giving sight?  Indeed in that are signs for a 
people who believe.
87.And [warn of] the Day the Horn will be blown, and whoever 
is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified 
except whom All Œh wills.  And all will come to Him humbled.
88.And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they 
will pass as the passing of clouds.  [It is] the work of AllŒh, 
who perfected all things.  Indeed, He is Acquainted with that 
which you do.

better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be safe.
90.And whoever comes with an evil deed1018–their faces wi ll be 
overturned into the Fire, [and it will be said], "Are you 
recompensed except for what you used to do?"
91.[Say, O Muúammad ], "I have only been commanded to worship
the Lord of this city,1019who made it sacred and to whom

2.These are verses of the clear Book.
3.We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth 
for a people who believe.
4.Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people 
into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their
[newborn] sons and keeping their females alive.  Indeed, he was 
of the corrupters.
5.And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed 
in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors
6.And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his 
minister] HŒmŒn and their soldiers through them1022that which 
they had feared.
7.And We inspired to the mother of Moses, "Suckle him; but when
you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do 
not grieve.  Indeed, We will return him to you and will make 
him [one] of the messengers."
8.And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so 
that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief.  
Indeed, Pharaoh and HŒmŒn and their soldiers were deliberate 
sinners.
9.And the wife of Pharaoh said, "[He will be] a comfort of the eye 
[i.e., pleasure] for me and for you.  Do not kill him; perhaps he 
may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son."  And they 
perceived not.1023

37610.And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else].  
She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him ha d We 
not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.
11.And she said to his sister, "Follow him"; so she watched him 
from a distance while they perceived not.
12.And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before,1024
so she said, "Shall I direct you to a household that will be 
responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his 
upbringing] sincere?"
13.So We restored him to his mother that she might be content 
and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of 
AllŒh is true. But most of them [i.e., the people] do not know.
14.And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] 
mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge.  
And thus do We reward the doers of good.
15.And he entered the city at a time of inatten tion by its people1025
and found therein two men fighting:  one from his faction and 
one from among his enemy.  And the one from his faction called 
for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses 
struck him and [unintentionally] killed him.  [Moses] said, 
"This is from the work of Satan.  Indeed, he is a manifest, 
misleading enemy."
16.He said, "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive 
me," and He forgave him.  Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the 
Merciful.
17.He said, "My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I 
will never be an assistant to the criminals."
18.And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure],
when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day 
cried out to him [once again].  Moses said to him, "Indee d, 
you are an evident, [persistent] deviator."
                                               
1024Prior to that, Moses had refused to nurse from any other woman.1025i.e., during the noon period of rest.

37719.And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to 
both of them, he1026said, "O Moses, do you intend to kill me 
as you killed someone yesterday?  You only want to be a tyrant 
in the land and do not wan t to be of the amenders."
20.And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running.  
He said, "O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over
you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to 
you of the sincere advisors."
21.So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension].  He said, 
"My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."
22.And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, 
"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way."
23.And when he came to the water [i.e., well] of Madyan, he 
found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he 
found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks].  
He said, "What is your circumstance?"  They said, "We do not 
water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks] ; and our father
is an old man."
24.So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the 
shade and said, "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good 
You would send down to me, in need."
25.Then one of the two women came to him walking with shynes s.  
She said, "Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward 
you for having watered for us."  So when he came to him1027
and related to him the story, he said, "Fear not.  You have 
escaped from the wrongdoing people."
26.One of the women said, "O my fathe r, hire him.  Indeed, the 
best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."
27.He said, "Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two 
                                               
1026i.e., the Israelite, thinking that Moses meant to strike him.  Some
commentators have attributed the words to the Copt; however, the 
Israelite was the only one who knew of the previous occurrence.1027Prophet ShuÔayb, the father of the two women.

378daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years;
but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favo r] from you.  And I
do not wish to put you in difficulty.  You will find me, if All Œh
wills, from among the righteous."
28.[Moses] said, "That is [established] between me and you.  
Whichever of the two terms I complete –there is no injustice 
to me, and A llŒh, over what we say, is Witness."
29.And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling 
with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a 
fire.  He said to his family, "Stay here; indeed, I have perceived
a fire.  Perhaps I will brin g you from there [some] information 
or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves."
30.But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the
valley in a blessed spot –from the tree,1028"O Moses, indeed I 
am All Œh, Lord of the worlds ."
31.And [he was told], "Throw down your staff."  But when he 
saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did 
not return.1029  [AllŒh said], "O Moses, approach and fear not.  
Indeed, you are of the secure.
32.Insert your hand into the ope ning of your garment; it will come
out white, without disease.  And draw in your arm close to you
[as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your 
Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment.  Indeed, they have been
a people defiantly disobedient."
33.He said, "My Lord, indeed I killed from among them someone,
and I fear they will kill me.
34.And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so 
send him with me as support, verifying me.  Indeed, I fear that 
they will deny me."
35.[AllŒh] said , "We will strengthen your arm through your brother
and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you.  [It

379will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will 
be the predominant."
36.But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evi dences,
they said, "This is not except invented magic, and we have not 
heard of this [religion] among our forefathers."
37.And Moses said, "My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] 
of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will 
be succession in the home.1030  Indeed, wrongdoers do not 
succeed."
38.And Pharaoh said, "O eminent ones, I have not known you to 
have a god other than me.  Then ignite for me, O HŒmŒn, [a 
fire] upon the clay1031and make for me a tower that I may 
look at the God of Moses.  And indeed, I do think he is among 
the liars."
39.And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without 
right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.
40.So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea.1032  
So see how was t he end of the wrongdoers.
41.And We made them leaders1033inviting to the Fire, and on the 
Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.
42.And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on 
the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised.1034
43.And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the 
former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance
and mercy that they might be reminded.
                                               
1030i.e., in this world or in the Hereafter.1031From which bricks are made.1032AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) caused them to leave all their worldly 
wealth behind and enter the sea in pursuit of the Children of Israel.  See 
26:52 -66.1033i.e., examples or precedents, followed by subsequent tyra nts.1034Literally, "those made hideous," who will be far removed from all good 
and mercy.

38044.And you, [O Muúammad ], were not on the western side [of 
the mount] when We revealed toMoses the command, and 
you were not among the witnesses [to that].
45.But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and 
prolonged was their duration.1035  And you were not a resident 
among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but 
We were s enders [of this message].1036
46.And you were not at the side of the mount when We called 
[Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a 
people to whom no warner had come before you that they 
might be reminded.
47.And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their 
hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, "Our Lord, why 
did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed 
Your verses and been among the believers?"...1037
48.But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, "Why 
was he not given like that which was given to Moses?"  Did 
they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses before?  
They said, "[They are but] two works of magic supporting 
each other,1038and indeed we are, in both, disbelievers."
49.Say, "Then bring a scripture from All Œh which is more guiding 
than either of them that I may follow it, if you should be 
truthful."
50.But if they do not respond to you –then know that they only 
follow their [own] desires.  And who is more astray than one 
who follows hi s desire without guidance from All Œh?  Indeed, 
AllŒh does not guide the wrongdoing people.
                                               
1035So they forgot and neglected the ordinances of All Œh.1036The Prophet () had no way of obtaining this information except 
through All Œh's revelation.1037The conclusion of the sentence is understood to be "...We would not 
have sent messengers," meaning that AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) sent 
messengers and sent Muúammad () with the final scripture to 
mankind so that no one could claim that punishment was imposed 
unjustly witho ut warning.1038The reference is by the disbelievers of Quraysh to the QurÕ Œn and the Torah.

38151.And We have [repeatedly] conveyed to them the word [i.e., 
the QurÕ Œn] that they might be reminded.
52.Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it –they1039are 
believers in it.
53.And when it is recited to them, they say, "We have believed in 
it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord.  Indeed we were, 
[even] before it, Muslims [i.e., submitting to All Œh]."
54.Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently 
endured and [because] they avert evil through good, and from 
what We have provided them they spend.
55.And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say,
"For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds.  Peace will 
be upon you;1040we seek not the ignorant."
56.Indeed, [O Muúammad ], you do not guide whom you like, but 
AllŒh guides whom He wills.  And He is most knowing of the 
[rightly] guided.
57.And they [i.e., the Quraysh] say, "If we were to follow the 
guidance with you, we would be swept1041from our land."  
Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary to which 
are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us?  But 
most of them do not know.
58.And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in 
its [way of] living, and those are their dwellings which have 
not been inhabited after them except briefly.1042  And it is We 
who were the inheritors.
59.And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He 
had sent to their mother [i.e., principal city] a messenger
reciting to them Our verses.  And We would not destroy the 
cities except while their people were wrongdoers.
                                               
1039i.e., the sincere believers among them.1040This is not the Isl Œmic greeting of "Peace be upon you."  Rather, it means
"You are secure from being treated in a like mann er by us."1041By the other Arab tribes.1042By travelers seeking temporary shelter.  The reference is to the ruins 
which were visible to the Quraysh during their journeys.

38260.And whatever thing you [people] have been given –it is [only for] 
the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment.  And what is
with All Œh isbetter and more lasting; so will you not use reason?
61.Then is he whom We have promised a good promise which he 
will meet [i.e., obtain] like he for whom We provided 
enjoyment of worldly life [but] then he is, on the Day of 
Resurrection, among those pre sented [for punishment in Hell]?
62.And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, "Where are 
My 'partners' which you used to claim?"
63.Those upon whom the word1043will have come into effect will 
say, "Our Lord, these are the ones we led to error.  We l ed them
to error just as we were in error.  We declare our disassociation
[from them] to You.  They did not used to worship [i.e., obey] 
us."1044
64.And it will be said, "Invoke your 'partners, '"and they will 
invoke them; but they will not respond to them, and they will 
see the punishment.  If only they had followed guidance!
65.And [mention] the Day He will call them and say, "What did 
you answer the messengers?"
66.But the information1045will be unapparent to them that Day, 
so they will not [be able to] as k one another.
67.But as for one who had repented, believed, and done 
righteousness, it is expected [i.e., promised by AllŒh] that he 
will be among the successful.
68.And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them
was the choice.  Exalted is All Œh and high above what they 
associate with Him.
69.And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what 
they declare.
                                               
1043The decree for their punishment.1044i.e., We did not compel them, and they did not obey us; instead, they 
obeyed their own desires and inclinations.1045By which they might invent lies or excuses.

38370.And He is All Œh; there is no deity except Him.  To Him is 
[due all] praise in the first [life] and the Hereafter.  And His i s 
the [final] decision, and to Him you will be returned.
71.Say, "Have you considered:1046  if All Œh should make for you 
the night continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity 
other than All Œh could bring you light?  Then will you not hear?"
72.Say, "Have you considered:  if All Œh should make for you the 
day continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity other 
than AllŒh could bring you a night in which you may rest?  
Then will you not see?"
73.And out of His mercy He made for you the night an d the day 
that you may rest therein and [by day] seek from His bounty 
and [that] perhaps you will be grateful.
74.And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, "Where are 
My 'partners' which you used to claim?"
75.And We will extract from every nation a witness and say, 
"Produce your proof," and they will know that the truth belongs
to All Œh, and lost from them is that which they used to invent.
76.Indeed, QŒr´n was from the people of Moses, but he tyrannized
them.  And We gave him of treasures whose keys would burden
a band of strong men; thereupon his people said to him, "Do 
not exult.  Indeed, All Œh does not like the exultant.
77.But seek, through that which All Œh has given you, the home of 
the Hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world.  
And do good as AllŒh has done good to you.  And desire not 
corruption in the land.  Indeed, All Œh does not like corrupters."
78.He said, "I was only given it because of knowledge I have."  
Did he not know that AllŒh had destroyed before him of 
generations those who were greater than him in power and 
greater in accumulation [of wealth]?  But the criminals, about 
their sins, will not be asked.1047
                                               
1046Meaning "Inform me if you really know."1047There will be no need to enumerate their sins separately, as their quantity
is obvious and more than sufficien t to warrant punishment in Hell.

S´rah 28–al-Qa§a§ JuzÕ 20
38479.So he came out before his people in his adornment.  Those 
who desired the worldly life said, "Oh, would that we had like 
what was given to QŒr´n.  Indeed, he is one of great fortune."
80.But those who had been given knowledge said, "Woe to you!  
The reward of AllŒh is better for he who believes and does 
righteousness.  And none are granted it except the pa tient."
81.And We caused the earth to swallow him and his home.  And 
there was for him no company to aid him other than All Œh, nor 
was he of those who [could] defend themselves.
82.And those who had wished for his position the previous day 
began to say, "Oh, how AllŒh extends provision to whom He 
wills of His servants and restricts it!  If not that AllŒh had 
conferred favor on us, He would have caused it to swallow us.  
Oh, how the disbelievers do not succeed!"
83.That home of the Hereafter We assign to those who do not 
desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption.  And the [best]
outcome is for the righteous.
84.Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed 
will have better than it; and whoever comes with an evil deed –
then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except 
[as much as] what they used to do.
85.Indeed, [O Muúammad ], He who imposed upon you the QurÕ Œn
will take you back to a place of return.1048  Say, "My Lord is 
most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear er ror."
86.And you were not expecting that the Book would be conveyed 
to you, but [it is] a mercy from your Lord.  So do not be an 
assistant to the disbelievers.1049
87.And never let them avert you from the verses of AllŒh after 
they have been revealed to you.  And invite [people] to your 
Lord.  And never be of those who associate others with All Œh.
                                               
1048Meaning to Makkah (in this life) or to Paradise (in the Hereafter).1049In their religion by making any concessions to their beliefs.

except Him.  Everything will be destroyed except His Face.1050  
His is the judgement, and to Him yo u will be returned.

2.Do the people think that they will be left to say, "We believe" 
and they will not be tried?
3.But We have certainly tried those before them, and All Œh will 
surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely 
make evident the liars.

Indeed, All Œh is Free from need of the worlds.

they say, "Indeed, We were with you."  Is not All Œh most knowing
of wh at is within the breasts of the worlds [i.e., all creatures]?
11.And AllŒh will surely make evident those who believe, and 
He will surely make evident the hypocrites.
12.And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Follow 
our way, and we will carry your sins."1054  But they will not 
carry anything of their sins.  Indeed, they are liars.
13.But they will surely carry their [own] burdens and [other] 
burdens along with their burdens,1055and they will surely be 
questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they used 
to invent.
14.And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained 
among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood 
seized them while they were wrongdoers.
15.But We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We 
made it1056a sign for the worlds.
16.And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, "Worship 
AllŒh and fear Him.  That is best for you, if you should know.
17.You only worship, besides AllŒh, idols, and you produce a 
falsehood.  Indeed, those you worship besid es AllŒh do not 
possess for you [the power of] provision.  So seek from All Œh 
provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him.  To Him 
you will be returned."

although it will not lessen the burden of the latter.1056i.e., the ship, the event or the story.1057Commentators have differed over this verse –whether it is a continuation
of the words of Prophet Abraham or words of comfort given by All Œh to 
Prophe t Muúammad (), which according to context seems more likely.

repeats it?  Indeed that, for All Œh, is easy.
20.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Travel through the land and observe how 
He began creati on.  Then AllŒh will produce the final creation
[i.e., development].  Indeed All Œh, over all things, is competent."
21.He punishes whom He wills and has mercy upon whom He wills,
and to Him you will be returned.
22.And you will not cause failure [to All Œh] upon the earth or in 
the heaven.  And you have not other than All Œh any protector 
or any helper.
23.And the ones who disbelieve in the signs of AllŒh and the 
meeting with Him –those have despaired of My mercy, and 
they will have a painful punishment.
24.And the answer of his [i.e., Abraham's] people was not but that 
they said, "Kill him or burn him," but AllŒh saved him from 
the fire.  Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
25.And [Abraham] said, "You have only taken, other than All Œh, 
idols as [a bond of] affection among you in worldly life.  Then 
on the Day of Resurrection you will deny one another and 
curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you 
will not have any helpers."
26.And Lotbelieved him.  [Abraham] said, "Inde ed, I will emigrate
to [the service of] my Lord.  Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might,
the Wise."
27.And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob and placed in his 
descendants prophethood and scripture.  And We gave him his 
reward in this world, and indeed, he is in the Hereafter among 
the righteous.
28.And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Indeed, you
commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from
among the worlds.
29.Indeed, you approach men and obstruct the road1058and commit
in your meeting s [every] evil."  And the answer of his people 
                                               
1058i.e., commit highway robbery and acts of aggression against travelers.

389was not but that they said, "Bring us the punishment of All Œh, 
if you should be of the truthful."
30.He said, "My Lord, support me against the corrupting people."
31.And when Our messengers [i.e., angels] came to Abraham 
with the good tidings,1059they said, "Indeed, we will destroy 
the people of that [i.e., Lot's] city.  Indeed, its people have been
wrongdoers."
32.[Abraham] said, "Indeed, within it is Lot."  They said, "We are
more knowing of who is within it.  We will surely save him 
and his family, except his wife.  She is to be of those who 
remain behind."
33.And when Our messengers [i.e., angels] came to Lot, he was 
distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort.1060  
They said, "Fear not, nor grieve .  Indeed, we will save you and
your family, except your wife; she is to be of those who remain
behind.
34.Indeed, we will bring down on the people of this city punishment
from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient."
35.And We have certain ly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a 
people who use reason.
36.And to Madyan [We sent] their brother ShuÔayb, and he said, 
"O my people, worship All Œh and expect the Last Day and do 
not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."
37.But the y denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they 
became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.
38.And [We destroyed] ÔAad and Tham´d, and it has become clear 
to you from their [ruined] dwellings.  And Satan had made 
pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path,
and they were endowed with perception.

39039.And [We destroyed] QŒr´n and Pharaoh and HŒmŒn.  And 
Moses had already come to them with clear evidences, and 
they were arrogant in the land, but they were not outrunners 
[of Our pun ishment].
40.So each We seized for his sin; and among them were those 
upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them were 
those who were seized by the blast [from the sky], and among 
them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and 
among them were those whom We drowned.  And All Œh would
not have wronged them, but it was they who were wronging 
themselves.
41.The example of those who take allies other than AllŒh is like 
that of the spider who takes [i.e., constructs] a home.  And 
indeed, the we akest of homes is the home of the spider, if they 
only knew.
42.Indeed, All Œh knows whatever thing they call upon other than 
Him.  And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
43.And these examples We present to the people, but none will 
understand them exc ept those of knowledge.
44.AllŒh created the heavens and the earth in truth.  Indeed in 
that is a sign for the believers.
45.Recite, [O Muúammad ], what has been revealed to you of the 
Book and establish prayer.  Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality
and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of AllŒh is greater.  
And All Œh knows that which you do.
46.And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a 
way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among 
them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to 
us and revealed to you.  And our God and your God is one; 
and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."
47.And thus We have sent down to you the Book [i.e., the QurÕ Œn].  
And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe
in it.  And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe
in it.  And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.

S´rah 29–al-ÔAnkab´t JuzÕ 21
39148.And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe
one with your right hand.  Then [i.e., otherwise] the falsifie rs 
would have had [cause for] doubt.
49.Rather, it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] is distinct verses [preserved] within 
the breasts of those who have been given knowledge.  And 
none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.
50.But they say, "Why are not signs sent down to him from his 
Lord?"  Say, "The signs are only with All Œh, and I am only a 
clear warner."
51.And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the 
Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] which is recited to them?  Indeed in 
that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.
52.Say, "Sufficient is All Œh between me and you as Witness.  He 
knows what is in the heavens and earth.  And they who have 
believed in falsehood and disbelieved in AllŒh –it is those 
who are the losers."
53.And they urge you to hasten the punishment.  And if not for 
[the decree of] a specified term, punishment would have 
reached them.  But it will surely come to them suddenly while 
they perceive not.
54.They urge you to hasten the punishment.  And indeed, Hell 
will be encompassing o f the disbelievers
55.On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them 
and from below their feet and it is said, "Taste [the result of] 
what you used to do."
56.O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious,
so worship only Me.
57.Every soul will taste death.  Then to Us will you be returned.
58.And those who have believed and done righteous deeds –We will
surely assign to them of Paradise [elevated] chambers beneath 
which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally.  Excellent is
the reward of the [righteous] workers
59.Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.

39260.And how many a creature carries not its [own] provision.  All Œh 
provides for it and for you.  And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
61.If you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth and 
subjected the sun and the moon?" they would surely say, 
"AllŒh."  Then how are they deluded?
62.AllŒh extends provision for whom He wills of His servants 
and restricts for him.  Indeed All Œh is, of all things, Knowing.
63.And if you asked them, "Who sends down rain from the sky 
and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?" they 
would surely say, "All Œh."  Say, "Praise to All Œh"; but most of 
them do not reason.
64.And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement.  
And indeed, the home of the Hereafter –that is the [eternal] life,
if only they knew.
65.And when they board a ship, they supplicate All Œh, sincere to 
Him in religion [i.e., faith and hope].  But when He delivers 
them to the land, at once th ey associate others with Him
66.So that they will deny what We have granted them, and they 
will enjoy themselves. But they are going to know.1061
67.Have they not seen that We made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, 
while people are being taken away1062all around th em?  Then 
in falsehood do they believe, and in the favor of AllŒh they 
disbelieve?
68.And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about All Œh
or denies the truth when it has come to him?  Is there not in 
Hell a [sufficient] residence for the disbeli evers?
69.And those who strive for Us –We will surely guide them to 
Our ways.1063  And indeed, All Œh is with the doers of good.
                                               
1061Grammatically, the verse may also be read as a threat, i.e., "So let them 
deny what We have granted them and let them enjoy themselves, for 
they are going to know."1062i.e., killed and taken captive.1063The various ways and means to attain the acceptance and pleasure of All Œh.

2.The Byzantines have been defeated1066
3.In the nearest land.  Bu t they, after their defeat, will overcome
4.Within three to nine years.  To AllŒh belongs the command 
[i.e., decree] before and after.  And that day the believers will 
rejoice
5.In the victory of All Œh.1067  He gives victory to whom He wills, 
and He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
6.[It is] the promise of All Œh.  All Œh does not fail in His promise, 
but most of the people do not know.
7.They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the 
Hereafter, are unaware.
8.Do they not contemplate within themselves?1068  AllŒh has not 
created the heavens and the earth and what is between them 
except in truth and for a specified term.  And indeed, many of 
the people, in the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers.
9.Have they not traveled through th e earth and observed how was 
the end of those before them?  They were greater than them in 
power, and they plowed [or excavated] the earth and built it up 
more than they [i.e., the Makkans] have built it up, and their 
messengers came to them with clear evidences.  And AllŒh 
would not ever have wronged them, but they were wronging 
themselves.

39410.Then the end of those who did evil was the worst [consequence]
because they denied the signs of AllŒh and used to ridicule 
them.
11.AllŒh begins creation; then He will repeat it; then to Him you 
will be returned.
12.And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will be in despair.
13.And there will not be for them among their [alleged] partners 
any intercessors, and they will [then] be disbelievers in their 
partners.
14.And the Day the Hour appears –that Day they will become 
separated.
15.And as for those who had believed and done righteous deeds, 
they will be in a garden [of Paradise], delighted.
16.But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our verses and 
the meeting of the Hereafter, those will be brought into the 
punishment [to remain].
17.So exalted is All Œh when you reach the evening and when you 
reach the morning.
18.And to Him is [due all] praise throughout the heavens and the 
earth.  And [exalted is He] at night and when you are at noon.
19.He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of 
the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness.  
And thus will you be brought out.1069
20.And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, 
suddenly you were human beings dispersing [throughout the 
earth].
21.And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves 
mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed 
between you affection and mercy .  Indeed in that are signs for 
a people who give thought.

39522.And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth 
and the diversity of your languages and your colors.  Indeed in 
that are signs for those of knowledge.
23.And of His signs is your sleep by night and day and your 
seeking of His bounty.  Indeed in that are signs for a people 
who listen.
24.And of His signs is [that] He shows you the lightening [causing]
fear and aspiration, and He sends down rain from the sky by 
which He brings to life the earth after its lif elessness.  Indeed 
in that are signs for a people who use reason.
25.And of His signs is that the heaven and earth stand [i.e., remain]
by His command.  Then when He calls you with a [single] call 
from the earth, immediately you will come forth.
26.And t o Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth.  All 
are to Him devoutly obedient.
27.And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that is 
[even] easier for Him.  To Him belongs the highest description
[i.e., attribute] in the heavens and earth.  And He is the Exalted
in Might, the Wise.
28.He presents to you an example from yourselves.  Do you have 
among those whom your right hands possess [i.e., slaves] any 
partners in what We have provided for you so that you are equal
therein [and] would fear them as your fear of one another 
[within a partnership]?1070  Thus do We detail the verses for a 
people who use reason.
29.But those who wrong follow their [own] desires without 
knowledge.   Then who can guide one whom AllŒh has sent 
astray?  And for them there are no helpers.
30.So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the religion, inclining to 
truth.  [Adhere to] the fi‹rah1071of AllŒh upon which He has 
created [all] people.  No change should there be in the creation

396of AllŒh.1072  That is the correct religion, but most of the 
people do not know.
31.[Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and 
establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others 
with All Œh
32.[Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects,
every faction rejoicing in what it has.1073
33.And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their 
Lord, turning in repentance to Him.  Then when He lets them 
taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others 
with their Lord,
34.So that they will deny what We have granted them.1074  Then 
enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.
35.Or have We sent down to them an authority [i.e., a proof or 
scripture], and it speaks of what they have been associating 
with Him?
36.And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, 
but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth, 
immediately they despair.
37.Do they not see that AllŒh extends provision for whom He 
wills and restricts [it]?  Indeed in that are signs for a people 
who be lieve.
38.So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveler.   
That is best for those who desire the countenance of All Œh, and
it is they who will be the successful.
39.And whatever you give for interest [i.e., advantage] to increase
within the wealth of people1075will not increase with AllŒh.  
                                               
1072i.e., let people remain true to their fi‹rah within the religion of Isl Œm.1073Of beliefs, opinions, customs, etc.1074Or "So let them deny what We have granted them."1075The phrase includes several connotations, among them:  a) that which is 
given as usury or interest, b) that which is given on the condition that it 
be repaid with interest, and c) a gift given with the intention of obtaining
from the recipient greater benefit or a larger gift.

S´rah 30–ar-R´m JuzÕ 21
397But what you give in zakŒh,1076desiring the countenance of 
AllŒh –those are the multipliers.1077
40.AllŒh is the one who created you, then provided for you, then 
will cause you to die, and then will give you life.  Are there 
any of your "partners" who does anything of that?  Exalted is 
He and high above what they associate with Him.
41.Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason 
of] what the hands of people have earned so He [i.e., AllŒh] 
may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have 
done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].
42.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Travel through the land and observe how
was the end of those before.  Most of them were associators 
[of oth ers with All Œh].
43.So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the correct religion before
a Day comes from All Œh of which there is no repelling.  That 
Day, they will be divided.1078
44.Whoever disbelieves –upon him is [the consequence of] his 
disbelief.  Andwhoever does righteousness –they are for 
themselves preparing,
45.That He may reward those who have believed and done 
righteous deeds out of His bounty.  Indeed, He does not like 
the disbelievers.
46.And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bring ers of 
good tidings and to let you taste His mercy [i.e., rain] and so 
the ships may sail at His command and so you may seek of 
His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.
47.And We have already sent messengers before you to their peoples,
and they came to them with clear evidences; then We took 
retribution from those who committed crimes, and incumbent 
upon Us was support1079of the believers.
                                               
1076The meaning of §adaqah (voluntary charity) is included here.1077Of their blessings on earth and their rewards in the Hereafter.1078Into those destined for Paradise and those destined for Hell.1079i.e., aid or the bestowal of victory.

S´rah 30–ar-R´m JuzÕ 21
39848.It is All Œh who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds and 
spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them 
fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them.  And 
when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, 
immediately they rejoice
49.Although they were, before it was sent down upon them –
before that, in despair.
50.So observ e the effects of the mercy of AllŒh –how He gives 
life to the earth after its lifelessness.  Indeed, that [same one] 
will give life to the dead, and He is over all things competent.
51.But if We should send a [bad] wind and they saw [their crops] 
turned yellow, they would remain thereafter disbelievers.1080
52.So indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make
the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs, retreating.
53.And you cannot guide the blind away from their error.  You will
only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are 
Muslims [in submission to All Œh].
54.AllŒh is the one who created you from weakness, then made 
after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness 
and white hair.  He creates what He wills, and He is the Knowing,
the Competent.
55.And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will swear they 
had remained but an hour.  Thus they were deluded.
56.But those who were given knowledge and faith will say, "You 
remained the extent of AllŒh's decree until the Day of 
Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did 
not used to know."1081
57.So that Day, their excuse will not benefit those who wronged, 
nor will they be asked to appease [All Œh].
58.And We have certainly presented to the people in this QurÕ Œn 
                                               
1080Denying and ungrateful for the previous favors of All Œh.1081i.e., acknowledge the truth.

S´rah 30–ar-R´m JuzÕ 21
399from every [kind of] example.  But, [O Muúammad ], if you 
should bring them a sign, the disbelievers will surely say, 
"You [believers] are but falsifiers."
59.Thus does All Œh seal the hearts of those who do not know.1082
60.So be patient.  Indeed, the promise of AllŒh is truth.  And let 
them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith].

11.This is the creation of All Œh.  So show Me what those other than
Him have created.  Rather, the wrongdoers are in clear error.
12.And We had certainly given LuqmŒn wisdom [and said], "Be 
grateful to All Œh."  And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the 
benefit of] himself.  And whoever denies [His favor] –then 
indeed, All Œh is Free of need and Praiseworthy.
13.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when LuqmŒn said to his son 
while he was instructing him, "O my son, do not associate 
[anything] with All Œh.  Indeed, association [with Him] is great 
injustice."
14.And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents.  His
mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness,
and his weaning is in two years.  Be grateful to Me and to 
your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.
15.But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of 
which you have no knowledge,1087do not obey them but 
accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and 
follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance].  
Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about 
what you used to do.
16.[And LuqmŒn said], "O my son, indeed if it [i.e., a wrong]

rock or [anywhe re] in the heavens or in the earth, AllŒh will 
bring it forth.  Indeed, All Œh is Subtle and Acquainted.
17.O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is 
wrong, and be patient over what befalls you.  Indeed, [all] that 
is of the matters [requiring] resolve .1088

40218.And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people1089
and do not walk through the earth exultantly.  Indeed, AllŒh 
does not like everyone self -deluded and boastful.
19.And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, 
the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys."
20.Do you not see that All Œh has made subject to you whatever is 
in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed
upon you His favors, [both] apparent and unapparent?  But of 
the peop le is he who disputes about All Œh without knowledge 
or guidance or an enlightening Book [from Him].
21.And when it is said to them, "Follow what All Œh has revealed,"
they say, "Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our
fathers."  Even if Satan was inviting them to the punishment 
of the Blaze?
22.And whoever submits his face [i.e., self] to All Œh while he is a 
doer of good –then he has grasped the most trustworthy 
handhold.  And to All Œh will be the outcome of [all] matters.
23.And whoever has disbelieved –let not his disbelief grieve you.   
To Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they 
did.  Indeed, All Œh is Knowing of that within the breasts.
24.We grant them enjoyment for a little; then We will force them 
to a massive punishmen t.
25.And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth?" 
they would surely say, "AllŒh."  Say, "[All] praise is [due] to 
AllŒh"; but most of them do not know.
26.To All Œh belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth.  Indeed,
AllŒh is the Free o f need, the Praiseworthy.
27.And if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea 
[was ink], replenished thereafter by seven [more] seas, the 
words1090of AllŒh would not be exhausted.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
Exalted in Might and Wise.

40328.Your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a 
single soul.1091  Indeed, All Œh is Hearing and Seeing.
29.Do you not see [i.e., know] that All Œh causes the night to enter 
the day and causes the day to enter the night and has subjected 
the sun and the moon, ea ch running [its course] for a specified 
term, and that All Œh, with whatever you do, is Acquainted?
30.That is bec ause AllŒh is the Truth, and that what they call 
upon other than Him is falsehood, and because AllŒh is the 
Most High, the Grand.
31.Do you n ot see that ships sail through the seaby the favor of 
AllŒh that He may show you of His signs?  Indeed in that are 
signs for ever yone patient and grateful.
32.And when waves come over them like canopies, they supplicate
AllŒh, sincere to Him in religion [i.e., faith] .  But when He 
delivers them to the land, there are [some] of them who are 
moderate [in faith].  And none rejects Our signs except 
everyone treacherous and ungr ateful.
33.O mankind, fear your Lord and fear a Day when no father will 
avail his son, nor will a son avail his father at all.  Indeed, the 
promise of All Œh is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you 
and be not deceived about All Œh by the Deceiver [i.e., Satan].
34.Indeed, AllŒh [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends 
down the rain and knows what is in the wombs.1092  And no 
soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul 
perceives in what land it will die.  Indeed, AllŒh is Knowing 
and Acquainted.
                                               
1091The re-creation and resurrection of one or of all is accomplished with 
equal ease by All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ).1092i.e., every aspect of the fetus' present and future existence.

2.[This is] the revelation of the Book about which there is no 
doubt from the Lord of the worlds.
3.Or do they say, "He invented it"?  Rather, it is the truth from 
your Lord, [O Muúammad ], that you may warn a people to 
whom no warner has come before you [so] perhaps they will 
be guided.
4.It is All Œh who created the heavens and the earth and whatever 
is between them in six days; then He established Himself above
the Throne.1095  You have not besides Him any protector or 
any intercessor; so will you not be remin ded?
5.He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it 
will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand 
years of those which you count.
6.That is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted
in Might, the Mercif ul,

creation of man from clay.
8.Then He made his posterity out of the extract of a liquid 
disdained.
9.Then He proportioned him and breathed into him from His 
[created] soul1096and made for you hearing and vision and 
hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful.
10.And they say, "When we are lost [i.e., disintegrated] within the 
earth, will we indeed be [recreated] in a new creation?"  Rather,
they are, in the meeting with their Lord, disb elievers.

12.If you could but see when the criminals are hanging their heads
before their Lord, [saying], "Our Lord, we have seen and hea rd,
so return us [to the world]; we will work righteousness.  Indeed,
we are [now] certain."
13.And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its 
guidance, but the word1097from Me will come into effect [that]
"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and pe ople all together.
14.So taste [punishment] because you forgot the meeting of this, 
your Day; indeed, We have [accordingly] forgotten you.  And 
taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do."
15.Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded
by them, fall down in prostration and exalt [All Œh] with praise 
of their Lord, and they are not arrogant.
16.Their sides part [i.e., they arise] from [their] beds; they 
supplicate their Lord in fear and aspiration, and from what We 
have provi ded them, they spend.1098
17.And no soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort 
for eyes [i.e., satisfaction] as reward for what they used to do.
18.Then is one who was a believer like one who was defiantly 
disobedient?  They are not equal.
19.As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, for them 
will be the Gardens of Refuge as accommodation for what 
they used to do.
20.But as for those who defiantly disobeyed, their refuge is the Fire.  
Every time they wish to emerge from it, they will be r eturned 
to it while it is said to them, "Taste the punishment of the Fire 
which you used to deny."
21.And We will surely let them taste the nearer punishment1099

406short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will return 
[i.e., repent].
22.And who is mor e unjust than one who is reminded of the verses 
of his Lord; then he turns away from them?  Indeed We, from
the criminals, will take retribution.
23.And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in 
doubt over his meeting.1100  And We made it [i.e., the Torah] 
guidance for the Children of Israel.
24.And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our 
command when they were patient and [when] they were certain
of Our signs.
25.Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of 
Resurrection conce rning that over which they used to differ.
26.Has it not become clear to them how many generations We 
destroyed before them, [as] they walk among their dwellings?  
Indeed in that are signs; then do they not hear?
27.Have they not seen that We drive water [in clouds] to barren 
land and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock 
eat and [they] themselves?  Then do they not see?
28.And they say, "When will be this conquest,1101if you should 
be truthful?"
29.Say, [O Muúammad ], "On the Day of Conques t the belief of 
those who had disbelieved will not benefit them, nor will they

1.O Prophet, fear AllŒh and do not obey the disbelie vers and the 
hypocrites.  Indeed, All Œh is ever Knowing and Wise.
2.And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord.  Indeed
AllŒh is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.
3.And rely upon All Œh; and sufficient is All Œh as Disposer of affairs.
4.AllŒh has not made for a man two hearts in his interior.  And He 
has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful1103your 
mothers.  And He has not made your claimed [i.e., adopted] 
sons your [true] sons.  That is [merely] your saying by your mouths,
but All Œhsays the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.
5.Call them1104by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in 
the sight of AllŒh.  But if you do not know their fathers –then
they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you.   
And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred
but [only for] what your hearts intended.  And ever is All Œh 
Forgiving and Merciful.
6.The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves ,1105
and his wives are [in the position of] their mothers.  And those 
of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the 
decree of AllŒh than the [other] believers and the emigrants, 
except that you may do to your close associates a kindness 
[through bequest].  That was in the Book1106inscri bed.

alliance of disbelieving Arab tribes against the Muslims in Mad¥nah for 
the battle called "al -AúzŒb" or "al -Khandaq" (the Trench).1103By the expression "You are to me like the back of my mother."  Such an 
oath taken against approaching one's wife was a pre-IslŒmic practice 
declared by All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) to be a sin requiring expiation 
as described in 58:3-4.1104Those children under your care.1105He () is more worthy of their obedience and loyalty and is more

4087.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when We took from the prophets
their covenant and from you and from Noah and Abraham and 
Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary; and We took from them a 
solemn covenant
8.That He may question the truthful about their truth.1107  And 
He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.
9.O you who have believed, remember the favor of AllŒh upon 
you when armies came to [attack] you and We sent upon them 
a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see.  And ever is All Œh,
of what you do, Seeing.
10.[Remember] when they came at you from above you and from 
below you, and when eyes shifted [in fear], and hearts reached 
the throats, and you assumed about All Œh [various] assumptions.
11.There the believers were tested and shaken with a severe 
shaking.
12.And [remember] when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts
is disease said, "AllŒh and His Messenger did not promise us 
except delusion,"
13.And when a faction of them said, "O people of Yathrib,1108
there is no stability for you [here], so return [home]."  And a 
party of them asked permission of the Prophet, saying, "Indeed,
our houses are exposed [i.e., unprotected]," while they were 
not exposed.  They did not intend except to flee.
14.And if they had been entered upon from allits [surrounding] 
regions and fitnah [i.e., disbelief] had been demanded of them, 
they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly.
15.And they had already promised AllŒh before not to turn their 
                                               
1107i.e., that He may ask the prophets what they conveyed to their people 
and what response they received.  "The truthful" may also refer to those 
who believe d in the message conveyed by the prophets and imparted it 
to others.1108The name by which al-Mad¥nah was known before the arrival of the 
Prophet ().

409backs [i.e., flee].  And ever is the promi se to All Œh [that about 
which one will be] questioned.
16.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Never will fleeing benefit you if you 
should flee from death or killing; and then [if you did], you 
would not be given enjoyment [of life] except for a little."
17.Say, "Who isit that can protect you from AllŒh1109if He 
intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy?"  And they 
will not find for themselves besides All Œh any protector or any 
helper.
18.Already AllŒh knows the hinderers1110among you and those 
[hypocrites] who sayto their brothers, "Come to us,"1111and 
do not go to battle, except for a few,1112
19.Indisposed1113toward you.  And when fear comes, you see them
looking at you, their eyes revolving like one being overcome by
death.  But when fear departs, they lash you with sharp tongues,
indisposed toward [any] good.  Those have not believed, so 
AllŒh has rendered their deeds worthless, and ever is that, for 
AllŒh, easy.
20.They think the companies have not [yet] withdrawn.1114  And 
if the companies should come [again], they would wish they 
were in the desert among the bedouins, inquiring [from afar] 
about your news.  And if they should be among you, they would
not fight except for a little.
21.There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of All Œh an 
excellent pattern1115for anyone whose hope is in All Œh and the 
Last Day and [who] remembers All Œh often.
                                               
1109i.e., prevent the will of All Œh from being carried out.1110Those who dissuade others from supporting the Prophet ( ) in battle.1111Rather than joining the Prophet ( ).1112Who went out of ulterior motives.1113Literally, "stingy," i.e., unwilling to offer any h elp.1114In their excessive fear the cowardly hypocrites could not believe the 
enemy forces had been defeated.1115An example to be followed.

41022.And when the believers saw the companies, they said, "This is 
what AllŒh and His Messenger had promised us, and AllŒh 
and His Messenger spoke the truth."  And it increase d them 
only in faith and acceptance.
23.Among the believers are men true to what they promised All Œh.  
Among them is he who has fulfilled his vow [to the death], 
and among them is he who awaits [his chance].  And they did 
not alter [the terms of their com mitment] by any alteration –
24.That AllŒh may reward the truthful for their truth and punish 
the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance.  Indeed, 
AllŒh is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
25.And AllŒh repelled those who disbelieved, in their rage, not 
having obtained any good.  And sufficient was AllŒh for the 
believers in battle, and ever is All Œh Powerful and Exalted in 
Might.
26.And He brought down those who supported them among the 
People of the Scripture1116from their fortresses and cast terro r 
into their hearts [so that] a party [i.e., their men] you killed, 
and you took captive a party [i.e., the women and children].
27.And He caused you to inherit their land and their homes and 
their properties and a land which you have not trodden.1117  
And e ver is All Œh, over all things, competent.
28.O Prophet, say to your wives, "If you should desire the worldly
life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and 
give you a gracious release.
29.But if you should desire AllŒh and His Messenger and the 
home of the Hereafter –then indeed, AllŒh has prepared for 
the doers of good among you a great reward."
30.O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you should commit a clear
immorality –for her the punishment would be doubled two fold,
and ever is that, for All Œh, easy.
                                               
1116The Jews of Ban´ Quray thah, who had violated their treaty with the Muslims.1117i.e., that taken in subsequent conquests.

41131.And whoever of you devoutly obeys All Œh and His Messenger 
and does righteousness –We will give her her reward twice; 
and We have prepared for her a noble provision.
32.O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women.  
If you fear AllŒh, then do not be soft in speech [to men],1118
lesthe in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with 
appropriate speech.
33.And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as 
[was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish
prayer and give zakŒh and obey AllŒh and His Messenger.  
AllŒh intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], 
O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with 
[extensive] purification.
34.And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of 
AllŒh and wisdom.1119  Indeed, AllŒh is ever Subtle and 
Acquainted [with all things].
35.Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men 
and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women,
the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient
women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men
and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the 
men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, 
and the men who remember AllŒh often and the women who 
do so –for them AllŒh has prepared forgiveness and a great 
reward.
36.It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when All Œh
and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should 
[thereafter] have any choice about their affair.  And whoever 
disobeys AllŒh and His Messenger has certainly strayed into 
clear error.
                                               
1118The meaning has also been given as "You are not like any among 
women if you fear All Œh.  So do not be soft in speech..."1119The teachings of the Prophet ( ) or his sunnah.

S´rah 33–al-AúzŒb JuzÕ 22
41237.And [remember, O Muúammad ], when you said to the one on 
whom AllŒh bestowed favor and you bestowed favor,1120
"Keep your wife and fear All Œh," while you concealed within 
yourself that which AllŒh is to disclose.1121  And you feared 
the people,1122while All Œh has more right that you fear Him .1123  
So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her 
to you in order that there not be upon the believers any 
discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed 
[i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them.  
And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of All Œh accomplished.
38.There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning 
that which AllŒh has imposed upon him.1124  [This is] the 
established way of All Œh with those [prophets] who have passed
on before.  And ever is the command of All Œh a destiny decreed.
39.[AllŒh praises] those who convey the messages of AllŒh1125
and fear Him and do not fear anyone but All Œh.  And sufficient
is All Œh as Accountant.
40.Muúammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he 
is] the Messenger of All Œh and seal [i.e., last] of the prophets.  
And ever is All Œh, of all things, Knowing.
41.O you who have believed, remember AllŒh with much 
remembrance
42.And exalt Him morning and afternoon.
                                               
1120Referring to the Prophet's freed slave, Zayd bin îŒ rithah.1121i.e., AllŒh's command to the Prophet () to marry Zaynab after Zayd 
divorced her.  This was to demonstrate that a man may marry a woman 
formerly married to his adopted son.1122i.e., feared their saying that the Prophet () had married the (former) 
wife of his son (which is prohibited by AllŒh in the case of a true, 
begotten son).1123By making known His command.1124Or permitted to him.1125i.e., the prophets (peace be upon them all) and af ter them, the followers 
of the final prophet, Muúammad (), who honestly convey AllŒh's 
message to the people.

41343.It is He who confers blessing upon you,1126and His angels 
[ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses 
into the light.  And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful.
44.Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, "Peace."  And 
He has prepared for them a noble reward.
45.O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a 
bringer of good tidings and a warner
46.And one who invites to AllŒh, by His permi ssion, and an 
illuminating lamp.
47.And give good tidings to the believers that they will have 
from All Œh great bounty.
48.And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites but do not 
harm them, and rely upon AllŒh.  And sufficient is All Œh as 
Disposer of affairs.
49.O you who have believed, when you marry believing women 
and then divorce them before you have touched them [i.e., 
consummated the marriage], then there is not for you any 
waiting period to count concerning them.  So provide for them 
and gi ve them a gracious release.
50.O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to 
whom you have given their due compensation1127and those 
your right hand possesses from what All Œh has returned to you 
[of captives] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the 
daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your 
maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who 
emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives 
herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her; 
[this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers.  We 
certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them 
                                               
1126i.e., All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) cares for you and covers you with His 
mercy.  An additional meaning is that He praises you in the presence of 
the angels.1127i.e., bridal gifts ( mahr ).

S´rah 33–al-AúzŒb JuzÕ 22
414concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, 
[but this is for you] in order that there will be upon you no 
discomfort [i.e., difficulty].  And ever is All Œh Forgiving and 
Merciful.
51.You, [O Muúammad ], may put aside whom you will of them1128
or take to yourself whom you will.  And any that you desire of 
those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated –
there is no blame upon you [in returning her].  That is more 
suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that 
they should be satisfied with what you have given them –all 
of them.  And AllŒh knows what is in your hearts.  And ever 
is All Œh Knowing and Forbearing.
52.Not lawful to you, [O Muúammad ], are [any additional] women

even if their beauty were to please you, except what your right
hand possesses.  And ever is All Œh, over all things, an Obse rver.
53.O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet
except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its 
readiness.  But when you are invited, then enter; and when you
have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conve rsation.   
Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is 
shy of [dismissing] you.  But AllŒh is not shy of the truth.  
And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from 
behind a partition.  That is purer for your hearts and their 
hearts.  And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm 
the Messenger of All Œh or to marry his wives after him, ever.  
Indeed, that would be in the sight of All Œh an enormity.
54.Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, indeed All Œh is ever, 
of all th ings, Knowing.
55.There is no blame upon them [i.e., women] concerning their 
fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers' sons or

415their sisters' sons or their women or those their right hands 
possess [i.e., slaves].1129  And fear All Œh.  Indeed AllŒh is ever,
over all things, Witness.
56.Indeed, All Œh confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels
[ask Him to do so].  O you who have believed, ask [AllŒh to 
confer] blessing upon him and ask [All Œh to grant him] peace.
57.Indeed, those who ab use All Œh and His Messenger –AllŒh has 
cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for 
them a humiliating punishment.
58.And those who harm believing men and believing women for 
[something] other than what they have earned [i.e., deserved] 
have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.
59.O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women 
of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their 
outer garments.1130  That is more suitable that they will be 
known1131and not be abused.  And ever is All Œh Forgiving 
and Merciful.1132
60.If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease1133and 
those who spread rumors in al -Mad¥nah do not cease, We will 
surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your 
neighbo rs therein except for a little,
61.Accursed wherever they are found, [being] seized and massacred
completely.
62.[This is] the established way of All Œh with those who passed on 
before; and you will not find in the way of All Œh any change.
                                               
1129It is permissible for a woman to appear before these people without 
complete covering and to be alone with them.  The brothers of both 
parents (uncles) are included as "fathers" or "parents," according to úad¥th.1130The jilbŒb, which is defined as a cloak covering the head and reaching 
to the ground, thereby covering the woman's entire body.1131As chaste believ ing women.1132Or "and All Œh was Forgiving and Merciful" of what occurred before this 
injunction or before knowledge of it.1133Referring here to those who commit adultery or fornication.

41663.People ask you concerning the Hour.  Say, "Knowledge of it is 
only with All Œh.  And what may make you perceive?  Perhaps
the Hour is near."
64.Indeed, All Œh has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them
a Blaze.
65.Abiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a 
helper.
66.The Day their faces will be turned about in the Fire, they will say,
"How we wish we had obeyed All Œh and obeyed the Messenger."
67.And they will say, "Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our masters and
our dignitaries,1134and they led us astray from the [right] way.
68.Our Lord, give them double the punishment and curse them 
with a great curse."
69.O you who have believed, be not like those who abused Moses;
then All Œh cleared him of what they said.  And he, in the sight 
of All Œh, was d istinguished.
70.O you who have believed, fear AllŒh and speak words of 
appropriate justice.
71.He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your 
sins.  And whoever obeys AllŒh and His Messenger has certainly
attained a great attainment.
72.Indeed, We offered the Trust1135to the heavens and the earth 
and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; 
but man [undertook to] bear it.  Indeed, he was unjust and 
ignorant.1136
73.[It1137was] so that AllŒh may punish the hypocrite men and

1.[All] praise is [due] to AllŒh, to whom belongs whatever is in

2.He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from 
it and what descends f rom the heaven and what ascends therein.  
And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.
3.But those who disbelieve say, "The Hour will not come to us."  
Say, "Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you.  [AllŒh is] 
the Knower of the unseen."  Not absent from Him is an atom's

smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register –
4.That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds.   
Those will have forgiveness and noble provisi on.
5.But those who strive against Our verses [seeking] to cause 
failure1140–for them will be a painful punishment of foul 
nature.
6.And those who have been given knowledge see that what is 
revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides to the

7.But those who disbelieve say, "Shall we direct you to a man

complete disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new

8.Has he invented about AllŒh a lie or is there in him madness?"

4199.Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is 
behind them of the heaven and earth ?  If We should will, We 
could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon 
them fragments from the sky.  Indeed in that is a sign for 
every servant turning back [to All Œh].
10.And We certainly gave David from Us bounty.  [We said], "O 
mountai ns, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as 
well]."  And We made pliable for him iron,
11.[Commanding him], "Make full coats of mail and calculate 
[precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness.  
Indeed I, of what you do, am Seeing."
12.And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind –its morning 
[journey was that of] a month –and its afternoon [journey was 
that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of 
[liquid] copper.  And among the jinn were those who worked 
for him by the permiss ion of his Lord.  And whoever deviated 
among them from Our command –We will make him taste of 
the punishment of the Blaze.
13.They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers,1141
statues,1142bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles.  [We 
said], "Work, O family of David, in gratitude."  And few of 
My servants are grateful.
14.And when We decreed for him [i.e., Solomon] death, nothing 
indicated to them [i.e., the jinn] his death except a creature of 
the earth eating his staff.1143  But when he fell, it became clear 
to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not 
have remained in humiliating punishment.1144
15.There was for [the tribe of] SabaÕ in their dwelling place a sign:  
                                               
1141Described by commentators as palaces, dwellings, or places of prayer.1142Which were not prohibited until the time of Prophet Muúammad ().1143Upon which he was leaning at the time of his death.  A termite continued
to gnaw into the stick until it collapse d under his weight.1144i.e., hard labor.  This verse is evidence that the jinndo not possess knowledge

420two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left.  [They were
told], "Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to 
Him.  A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord."
16.But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the 
flood of the dam,1145and We replaced their two [fields of] 
gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something 
of sparse lote trees.
17.[By] that We repaid them because they disbelieved.  And do 
We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?
18.And We placed between them and the cities which We had 
blessed1146[many] visible cities. And We determined between 
them the [distances of] journey,1147[saying], "Travel between 
them by night or by day in safety."
19.But [insolently] they said, "Our Lord, lengthen the distance 
between our journeys," and wronged themselves, so We made 
them narra tions1148and dispersed them in total dispersion.  
Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.
20.And Iblees had already confirmed through them1149his 
assumption,1150so they followed him, except for a party of 
believers.
21.And he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that 
We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who 
is thereof in doubt.  And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian.
22.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Invoke those you claim [as deities]

23.And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one 
whom He perm its.  [And those wait] until, when terror is 
removed from their hearts,1151they will say [to one another], 
"What has your Lord said?"  They will say, "The truth."  And 
He is the Most High, the Grand.
24.Say, "Who provides for you from the heavens and the ea rth?"  
Say, "All Œh.  And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance 
or in clear error."
25.Say, "You will not be asked about what we committed, and 
we will not be asked about what you do."
26.Say, "Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge

27.Say, "Show me those whom you have attached to Him as partners.   
No!  Rather, He [alone] is All Œh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
28.And We have not sent you except comprehensively1152to 
mankind as a brin ger of good tidings and a warner.  But most 
of the people do not know.
29.And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
30.Say, "For you is the appointment of a Day [when] you will not 
remain thereafter an hour, nor will you precede [i t]."
31.And those who disbelieve say, "We will never believe in this 
QurÕŒn nor in that before it."  But if you could see when the 
wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, refuting each 
others' words...1153  Those who were oppressed will say to 
those who were arrogant, "If not for you, we would have been 
believers."
                                               
1151i.e., the hearts of the angels who will be permitted to intercede.1152Literally, "inclusively, without exception."1153Having been left to the imagination, the conclusion of this sentence is 
estimated t o be "...you would see a dreadful sight."

42232.Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, 
"Did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you?  
Rather, you were criminals."
33.Those who were oppressed will s ay to those who were arrogant,
"Rather, [it was your] conspiracy of night and day when you 
were ordering us to disbelieve in AllŒh and attribute to Him 
equals."  But they will [all] confide regret when they see the 
punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those 
who disbelieved.  Will they be recompensed except for what 
they used to do?
34.And We did not send into a city any warner except that its 
affluent said, "Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, 
are disbelievers."
35.And they1154said, "We are more [than the believers] in wealth 
and children, and we are not to be punished."
36.Say, "Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills 
and restricts [it], but most of the people do not know."
37.And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you 
nearer to Us in position, but it is [by being] one who has 
believed and done righteousness.  For them there will be the 
double reward for what they did, and they will be in the upper 
chambers [of Paradise], safe [and secure].
38.And the ones who strive against Our verses to cause [them] 
failure1155–those will be brought into the punishment [to 
remain].
39.Say, "Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills 
of His servants and restricts [it] for him.  But whatever thing 
you spend [in His cause] –He will compensate it; and He is 
the best of providers."
40.And [mention] the Day when He will gather them all and then 
say to the angels, "Did these [people] used to worship you?"

42341.They will say, "Exalted are You!  You, [O AllŒh], are our 
benefactor excluding [i.e., not] them.  Rather, they used to 
worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them."
42.But today [i.e., the Day of Judgement] you do not hold for one 
another [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to 
those who wro nged, "Taste the punishment of the Fire, which 
you used to deny."
43.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
they say, "This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from 
that which your fathers were worshipping."  And they say, 
"This is not except a lie invented."  And those who disbelieve 
say of the truth when it has come to them, "This is not but 
obvious magic."
44.And We had not given them any scriptures which they could 
study, and We had not sent to them before you, [O Muúammad ],
any warner.
45.And those before them denied, and they [i.e., the people of 
Makkah] have not attained a tenth of what We had given them.   
But they [i.e., the former peoples] denied My messengers, so 
how [terrible] was My reproach.
46.Say, "I only advise y ou of one [thing] –that you stand for All Œh,
[seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought."   
There is not in your companion any madness.  He is only a 
warner to you before a severe punishment.
47.Say, "Whatever payment I might have as ked of you –it is yours.   
My payment is only from AllŒh, and He is, over all things, 
Witness."
48.Say, "Indeed, my Lord projects the truth, Knower of the unseen."
49.Say, "The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin 
[anything] nor repeat [it]."1156
                                               
1156This expression alludes to complete inability, meaning that falsehood

am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me.  Indeed, He is 
Hearing and near."
51.And if you could see1157when they are terrified but there is no 
escape, and they will be seized from a place nearby.
52.And they will [then] say, "We believe in it!"  But how for 
them will be the taking1158[of faith] from a place far away?1159
53.And they had already disbelieved in it before and would 
assault1160the unseen from a place far away.1161
54.And preve ntion will be placed between them and what they 
desire,1162as was done with their kind before.  Indeed, they were
in disquieting doubt [i.e., denial].

"How can they expect to obtain faith at this point?"1159i.e., their former life on earth, wherein they had every opportunity but 
which is now gone, never to return.1160Verbally, by conject ure and denial.1161i.e., a position far from truth.1162Meaning the attainment of faith and its benefits or entrance into Paradise.

AllŒh is over all things competent.
2.Whatever All Œh grants to people of mercy –none can withhold 
it; and whatever He withholds –none can release it thereafter.  
And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
3.O mankind, remember the favor of AllŒh upon you.  Is there 
any creator other than AllŒh who provides for you from the 
heaven and earth?  There is no deity except Him, so how are 
you deluded?
4.And if they deny you, [O Muúammad ] –already were 
messengers denied before you.  And to AllŒh are returned [all] 
matters.
5.O mankind, indeed the promise of AllŒh is truth, so let not the 
worldly life delude you and be not deceived abou t AllŒh by the 
Deceiver [i.e., Satan].
6.Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy.  He 
only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.
7.Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, and those 
who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and 
great reward.
8.Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made 
attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]?  For 
indeed, All Œh sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He 
wills.  So do not let yourself perish over them in regret.  Indeed, 
AllŒh is Knowing of what they do.

10.Whoever desires honor [through power] –then to All Œh belongs
all honor.1164  To Him ascends good speech, and righteous 
work raises it.1165  But they who plot evil deeds will have a 
severe punishment, and the plotting of those –it will perish.
11.And AllŒh created you from dust, then from a sperm -drop; 
then He made you mates.  And no female conceives nor does 
she give birth except with His knowledge.  And no aged 
person is granted [additional] life nor is his lifespan lessened 
but that it is i n a register.  Indeed, that for All Œh is easy.
12.And not alike are the two seas [i.e., bodies of water].  One is 
fresh and sweet, palatable for drinking, and one is salty and 
bitter.  And from each you eat tender meat and extract 
ornaments which you wear , and you see the ships plowing 
through [them] that you might seek of His bounty; and 
perhaps you will be grateful.
13.He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to 
enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon –each 
running [it s course] for a specified term.  That is All Œh, your Lord;
to Him belongs sovereignty.  And those whom you invoke other 
than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date 
seed.
14.If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if 
they heard, they would not respond to you.  And on the Day of 
Resurrection they will deny your association.1166  And none 
can inform you like [one] Acquainted [with all matters].
15.O mankind, you are those in need of All Œh, while All Œh is the 
Free of need, the Praiseworthy.

42716.If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new 
creation.
17.And that is for All Œh not difficult.
18.And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.  
And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] 
its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a 
close relative.  You can only warn those who fear their Lord 
unseen and have established prayer.  And whoever purifies 
himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul.  And 
to All Œhis the [final] destination.
19.Not equal are the blind and the seeing,
20.Nor are the darknesses and the light,

22.And not equal are the living and the dead.  Indeed, All Œh causes

graves.1168
23.You, [O Muúammad ], are not but a warner.
24.Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good 
tidings and a warner.  And there was no nation but that there 
had passed within it a warner.
25.And if they deny you –then already have those before them 
denied.  Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and 
written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture.
26.Then I seized the ones who disbelieved, and how [terrible] 
was My reproach.
27.Do you notsee that AllŒh sends down rain from the sky, and 
We produce thereby fruits of varying colors?  And in the 
mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and

arevarious colors similarly.  Only those fear All Œh, from among
His servants, who have knowledge.  Indeed, AllŒh is Exalted 
in Might and Forgiving.
29.Indeed, those who recite the Book of All Œh and establish prayer
and spend [in His cause] out of what We ha ve provided them, 
secretly and publicly, [can] expect a transaction [i.e., profit] 
that will never perish –
30.That He may give them in full their rewards and increase for

31.And that which W e have revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], of 
the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it.  Indeed 
AllŒh, of His servants, is Acquainted and Seeing.
32.Then We caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of 
Our servants;1169and among them is he who wrongs himself 
[i.e., sins], and among them is he who is moderate, and among 
them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of 
AllŒh.  That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.
33.[For them are] gardens of perpetual residence which they will
enter.  They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and 
pearls, and their garments therein will be silk.
34.And they will say, "Praise to All Œh, who has removed from us 
[all] sorrow.  Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative –
35.He who ha s settled us in the home of duration [i.e., Paradise] 
out of His bounty.  There touches us not in it any fatigue, and 
there touches us not in it weariness [of mind]."
36.And for those who disbelieve will be the fire of Hell.  [Death] 
is not decreed for th em1170so they may die, nor will its torment
be lightened for them.  Thus do We recompense every ungrateful
one.

42937.And they will cry out therein, "Our Lord, remove us;1171we 
will do righteousness –other than what we were doing!"  But 
did We not grant you lif e enough for whoever would remember
therein to remember, and the warner had come to you?  So taste
[the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.
38.Indeed, All Œh is Knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens
and earth.  Indeed, He i s Knowing of that within the breasts.
39.It is He who has made you successors upon the earth.  And 
whoever disbelieves –upon him will be [the consequence of] 
his disbelief.  And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not 
increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and 
the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except 
in loss.
40.Say, "Have you considered1172your 'partners' whom you 
invoke besides All Œh?  Show me what they have created from 
the earth, or have they partnership [w ith Him] in the heavens?  
Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on 
evidence therefrom?  [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not 
promise each other except delusion."1173
41.Indeed, All Œh holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease.  
And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] 
after Him.  Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.
42.And they swore by All Œh their strongest oaths that if a warner 
came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of 
the [previous] nations.  But when a warner came to them, it 
did not increase them except in aversion
43.[Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil 
plot does not encompass except its own people.  Then do they 
await except the way [i.e., fate] of the former people s?  But you 
will never find in the way [i.e., established method] of AllŒh 
                                               
1171The implication is "Return us to the previous world."1172Understood to mean "Tell me about..."1173By telling their followers that the so-called deities will intercede for 
them with All Œh.

430any change, and you will never find in the way of AllŒh1174
any alteration.1175
44.Have they not traveled through the land and observed how 
was the end of those before them?  And they we re greater than 
them in power.  But AllŒh is not to be caused failure [i.e., 
prevented] by anything in the heavens or on the earth.  Indeed, 
He is ever Knowing and Competent.
45.And if AllŒh were to impose blame on the people for what 
they have earned, Hewould not leave upon it [i.e., the earth] 
any creature.  But He defers them for a specified term.  And 
when their time comes, then indeed AllŒh has ever been, of 
His servants, Seeing.

2.By the w ise1178QurÕŒn,
3.Indeed you, [O Muúammad ], are from among the messengers,
4.On a straight path.
5.[This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
6.That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned,
so they are unaware.
7.Already the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon most 
of them, so they do not believe.
8.Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to 
their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.
9.And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a 
barrier and covered them, so they do not see.
10.And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do 
not warn them –they will not believe.
11.You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the 
Most Merciful unseen.  So giv e him good tidings of forgiveness
and noble reward.
12.Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what 
they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things 
We have enumerated in a clear register.
13.And present to them an example:  t he people of the city, when 
the messengers came to it –
14.When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We 
strengthened them with a third, and they said, "Indeed, we are 
messengers to you."

43215.They said, "You are not but human beings like us, and t he Most 
Merciful has not revealed a thing.  You are only telling lies."
16.They said, "Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you,
17.And we are not responsible except for clear notification."
18.They said, "Indeed, we consider you a bad omen.  If you do not
desist, we will surely stone you, and there will surely touch you,
from us, a painful punishment."
19.They said, "Your omen [i.e., fate] is with yourselves.  Is it1179
because you were reminded?  Rather, you are a transgressing 
people."
20.And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running.   
He said, "O my people, follow the messengers.
21.Follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they 
are [rightly] guided.
22.And why should I not worship He who created me and to whom
you w ill be returned?
23.Should I take other than Him [false] deities [while], if the Most
Merciful intends for me some adversity, their intercession will 
not avail me at all, nor can they save me?
24.Indeed, I would then be in manifest error.
25.Indeed, I h ave believed in your Lord, so listen to me."
26.It was said, "Enter Paradise."1180  He said, "I wish my people 
could know
27.Of how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the 
honored."
28.And We did not send down upon his people after him any 
soldiers from the heaven, nor would We have done so.
                                               
1179Your threat against us.1180An abrupt transfer to the Hereafter conveys the meaning that the man 
met a violent death at the hands of the disbelievers and so was martyred 
for the cause of All Œh.

43329.It was not but one shout,1181and immediately they were 
extinguished.
30.How regretful for the servants.  There did not come to them 
any messenger except that they used to ridicule him.
31.Have they not consi dered how many generations We destroyed 
before them –that they to them1182will not return?
32.And indeed, all of them will yet be brought present before Us.
33.And a sign for them is the dead earth.  We have brought it to 
life and brought forth from it gr ain, and from it they eat.
34.And We placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines 
and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs –
35.That they may eat of His fruit.1183  And their hands have not 
produced it,1184so will they not be grateful?
36.Exalted is He who created all pairs1185–from what the earth 
grows and from themselves and from that which they do not 
know.
37.And a sign for them is the night.  We remove1186from it the 
[light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness.
38.And the sun runs [on co urse] toward its stopping point.  That 
is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
39.And the moon –We have determined for it phases, until it 
returns [appearing] like the old date stalk.
40.It is not allowable [i.e., possible] for the su n to reach the moon,
nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is 
swimming.
                                               
1181From Gabriel or a blast from the sky.1182i.e., to those living presently in the world.1183i.e., that which All Œh has produced for them.1184An alternative meaning is "An d [eat from] what their hands have produced
[i.e., planted and harvested]."  Both are grammatically correct.1185Or "all species."1186Literally, "strip" or "peel."  Sunlight projected onto the earth is removed 
from it as the earth turns and night approaches.

S´rah 36–YŒ Seen JuzÕ 23
43441.And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers1187in a 
laden ship.
42.And We created for them from the likes of it that which they 
ride.
43.And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one 
responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they 
be saved
44.Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.
45.But when it is said to them, "Beware of what is before you and 
what is behind y ou;1188perhaps you will receive mercy..."1189
46.And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord 
except that they are from it turning away.
47.And when it is said to them, "Spend from that which AllŒh 
has provided for you," those who disbelieve say to those who 
believe, "Should we feed one whom, if AllŒh had willed, He 
would have fed?  You are not but in clear error."
48.And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"
49.They do not await except one blast1190which will seize them 
while they are disputing.
50.And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their 
people can they return.
51.And the Horn will be blown;1191and at once from the graves 
to their Lord they will hasten.
52.They will say, "O woe to us!  Who has raised us up from our 
                                               
1187Usually meaning "descendants" or "offspring," the word " dhurriyyah " is 
used here to denote forefathers (their being the offspring of Noah), who 
were saved from the flood.1188Of sins or of life in this world and the Hereafter.1189The conclusion of this sentence is understood to be "...they ignored the 
warning."1190Literally, "cry" or "shriek," meaning the first blast of the Horn which 
will strike dead every living thing on the earth without warning.1191For the second time, signaling the Resurrection.

435sleeping place?"  [The reply will be], "This is what the Most 
Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth."
53.It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought 
present before Us.
54.So today [i.e., the Day of Jud gement] no soul will be wronged 
at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you 
used to do.
55.Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused 
in [joyful] occupation –
56.They and their spouses –in shade, reclining on adorned cou ches.
57.For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request
[or wish]
58.[And] "Peace," a word from a Merciful Lord.
59.[Then He will say], "But stand apart today, you criminals.1192
60.Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not 
worship Satan –[for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy –
61.And that you worship [only] Me?  This is a straight path.
62.And he had already led astray from among you much of creation,
so did you not use reason?
63.This is the Hellfire which you w ere promised.
64.[Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny."1193
65.That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will 
speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to 
earn.
66.And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and 
they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?1194
                                               
1192i.e., remove yo urself from the ranks of the believers to be distinguished 
from them.1193Or "because you used to disbelieve."1194AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) could have left man without means of 
guidance in the life of this world, although in His mercy He did not.

Page 458:
S´rah 36–YŒ Seen JuzÕ 23
43667.And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing 
them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor 
could they return.1195
68.And he to whom We gra nt long life We reverse in creation;1196
so will they not understand?
69.And We did not give him [i.e., Prophet Muúammad ()] 
knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him.  It is not but a 
message and a clear QurÕ Œn
70.To warn whoever is alive1197and just ify the word [i.e., decree] 
against the disbelievers.
71.Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our 
hands1198have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are 
their owners?
72.And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride,
andsome of them they eat.
73.And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will 
they not be grateful?
74.But they have taken besides AllŒh [false] deities that perhaps 
they would be helped.
75.They are not able to help them, and they [themselve s] are for 
them soldiers in attendance.1199
76.So let not their speech grieve you.  Indeed, We know what 
they conceal and what they declare.
77.Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] 
sperm -drop –then at once1200he is a clear adversary?
                                               
1195He (subúŒna hu wa taÔŒlŒ ) could have prevented man from taking any 
action to benefit himself in this world or the Hereafter, yet He did not.1196In his physical and mental capacity.1197In heart and mind, i.e., the believers.1198See footnote to 2:19.1199Maintaining and protecti ng their "gods."  Another interpretation is that 
they (i.e., the gods) will be soldiers set against them in Hellfire.1200i.e., as soon as he becomes self -sufficient.

Page 459:
S´rah 36–YŒ Seen JuzÕ 23
43778.And he presents for Us an example1201and forgets his [own] 
creation.  He says, "Who will give life to bones while they are 
disintegrated?"
79.Say, "He will give them life who produced them the first time; 
and He is, of all creation, Knowing."
80.[It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then 
from it you ignite.
81.Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create 
the likes of them?  Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.
82.His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it,
"Be," and it is.
83.So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and 
to Him you will be returned.

101.So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy.
102.And when he reached with him [the age of] exertion,1213he 
said, "O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I [must] 
sacrifice you, so see what you think."  He said, "O my father, 
do as you are commanded.  You will find me, if AllŒh wills, 
of the steadfast."
103.And when they had both submitted1214and he put him down 
upon his forehead,
104.We called to him, "O Abraham,
105.You have fulfilled the vision."  Indeed, We thus reward the 
doers of good.
106.Indeed, this was the clear trial.
107.And We ransomed hi m with a great sacrifice,1215
108.And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
109."Peace upon Abraham."
110.Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
111.Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
112.And We gave him good tidings of I saac, a prophet from among 
the righteous.1216
113.And We blessed him and Isaac.  But among their descendants 
is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself [i.e., sinner].
114.And We did certainly confer favor upon Moses and Aaron.
115.And We saved them and their people from the great affliction,
116.And We supported them so it was they who overcame.
                                               
1213i.e., the ability to work and be of assistance.1214To the command of All Œh.1215AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) sent a huge ram to be sacrificed in place of 
Ishmael.1216This verifies that the firstborn son who was to be sacrificed was Ishmael 
and not Isaac, as claimed by the Jews and Christians.

121.Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
122.Indeed, they were of Our believing servants.
123.And indeed, Elias was from among the messengers,
124.When he said to his people, "Will y ou not fear All Œh?
125.Do you call upon BaÔl1217and leave the best of creators –
126.AllŒh, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?"
127.And they denied him, so indeed, they will be brought [for 
punishment],
128.Except the chosen servants of Al lŒh.
129.And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:
130."Peace upon Elias."1218
131.Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
132.Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.
133.And indeed, Lot was among the messengers.
134.[So menti on] when We saved him and his family, all,
135.Except an old woman [i.e., his wife] among those who remained
[with the evildoers].
136.Then We destroyed the others.
137.And indeed, you pass by them in the morning
138.And at night.  Then will you not us e reason?
139.And indeed, Jonah was among the messengers.

144.He would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are

145.But We threw him onto the open shore while he was ill.
146.And We caused to grow over him a gourd vine.1222
147.And We sent him1223to [his people of] a hundr ed thousand or 
more.
148.And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment [of life] for a 
time.
149.So inquire of them, [O Muúammad ], "Does your Lord have 
daughters while they have sons?1224
150.Or did We create the angels as females while they were 
witnesses? "
151.Unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that 
they say,
152."AllŒh has begotten," and indeed, they are liars.
153.Has He chosen daughters over sons?
154.What is [wrong] with you?  How do you make judgement?

them without permission from All Œh.1221Meaning that the belly of the fish would have become his grave.1222Which is known to give cooling shade and to be a repellent of flies.1223i.e., returned him thereafter.1224The people of Makkah claimed th at the angels were daughters of All Œh,

such claims] wil l be brought [to punishment].
159.Exalted is All Œh above what they describe,

161.So indeed, you [disbelievers] and whatever you worship,
162.You cannot tempt [anyone] away from Him

164.[The angels say],1226"There is not among us any except that 
he has a known position.1227
165.And indeed, we are those who line up [for prayer].
166.And indeed, we are those who exalt All Œh."
167.And indeed, they [i.e., the disbelievers] used to say,1228
168."If we had a message from [those of] the former peoples,
169.We would have been the chosen servants of All Œh."
170.But they disbelieved in it,1229so they are going to know.

17.Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant, David ,
the possessor of strength; indeed, he was one who repeatedly

18.Indeed, We subjected the mountains [to praise] with him, 
exalting [All Œh] in the [late] afternoon and [after] sunrise.
19.And the birds were assembled, all with him repeating [praises].
20.And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wi sdom and 
discernment in speech.
21.And has there come to you the news of the adversaries, when 
they climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber –
22.When they entered upon David and he was alarmed by them?  
They said, "Fear not.  [We are] two adversari es, one of whom 
has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth and do 
not exceed [it] and guide us to the sound path.

45023.Indeed this, my brother, has ninety -nine ewes, and I have one ewe; 
so he said, 'Entrust her to me,' and he overpowered me in sp eech."
24.[David] said, "He has certainly wronged you in demanding your
ewe [in addition] to his ewes.  And indeed, many associates 
oppress one another, except for those who believe and do 
righteous deeds –and few are they."  And David became 
certain tha t We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his 
Lord1240and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in 
repentance [to All Œh].
25.So We forgave him that; and indeed, for him is nearness to Us 
and a good place of return.
26.[We said], "O David, indeed We have made you a successor 
upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do 
not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from 
the way of All Œh."  Indeed, those who go astray from the way 
of AllŒh will have a severe punishment for having forgotten 
the Day of Account.
27.And We did not create the heaven and the earth and that between
them aimlessly.  That is the assumption of those who disbelieve,
so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire.
28.Or should We treat those who belie ve and do righteous deeds 
like corrupters in the land?  Or should We treat those who fear 
AllŒh like the wicked?
29.[This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O 
Muúammad ], that they might reflect upon its verses and that 
those of understandi ng would be reminded.
30.And to David We gave Solomon.  An excellent servant, indeed
he was one repeatedly turning back [to All Œh].
31.[Mention] when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon
the poised [standing] racehorses.
                                               
1240For his errors, such as fear and suspicion of the two m en at the outset, 
any mistake in judgement he might have made, concealed feelings of 
partiality, etc.

45132.And he said, "Indeed, I gave preference to the love of good 
[things] over the remembrance of my Lord until it [i.e., the sun]
disappeared into the curtain [of darkness]."
33.[He said], "Return them to me," and set about striking1241[their]
legs and necks.
34.And We certain ly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a 
body;1242then he returned.1243
35.He said, "My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such 
as will not belong to anyone after me.  Indeed, You are the 
Bestower."
36.So We subjected to him the wind blowing by his command, 
gently, wherever he directed,
37.And [also] the devils [of jinn] –every builder and diver
38.And others bound together in shackles.
39.[We said], "This is O ur gift, so grant or withhold without 
account."
40.And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.
41.And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, 
"Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment."
42.[So he was told], "Strike [the ground] with your foot; this is a 
[spring for a] cool bath and drink."
43.And We granted him his family and a like [number] with them 
as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding.
44.[We said], "And take in your hand a bunch [of grass] and strike
with it and do not break your oath."1244  Indeed, We found him 
                                               
1241With his sword as expiation.  Some commentaries have also suggested 
the meaning of "stroking" with the hand.1242Said to be a devil or a lifeless body (one without capability), but All Œh 
alone knows.1243To sovereignty and to All Œh in repentance.1244At a point during his illness, Job became angry with his wife and swore 
that if he recovered, he would punish her with one hundred lashes.  
According to AllŒh's instru ction, the oath was fulfilled by striking her 
once with one hundred blades of grass.

46.Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality:  remembrance
of the ho me [of the Hereafter].
47.And indeed they are, to Us, among the chosen and outstanding.
48.And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhul -Kifl, and all are

49.This is a reminder.  And indeed, for the righteous is a good

50.Gardens of perpetual residence, whose doors will be opened 
to them.
51.Reclining within them, they will call therein for abundant fruit 
and drink.
52.And with them will be women limiting [their] glances1245and 
of equal age.
53.This is what you, [the ri ghteous], are promised for the Day of 
Account.
54.Indeed, this is Our provision; for it there is no depletion.
55.This [is so].  But indeed, for the transgressors is an evil place 
of return –
56.Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the resting
place.
57.This –so let them taste it –is scalding water and [foul] purulence
58.And other [punishments] of its type [in various] kinds.
59.[Its inhabitants will say], "This is a company bursting in with
you.  No welcome for them.  Indeed, the y will burn in the Fire."
60.They will say, "Nor you!  No welcome for you.  You, [our

73.So the angels prostrated –all of them entirely,
74.Except Iblees ;1248he was arrogant and became among the 
disbelievers.
75.[AllŒh] said, "O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating 
to that which I created with My hands?1249  Were you arrogant 
[then], or were you [already] among the haughty?"

81.Until the Day of the time well -known."
82.[Iblees] said, "By Your might, I will surely mislead them all
83.Except, among them, Your chosen servants."
84.[AllŒh] said, "The truth [is My oath], and the truth I say –
85.[That] I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that 
follow you all together."
86.Say, [O Muúammad ], "I do not ask you for it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] 
any payment, and I am not of the prete ntious.

1.The revelation of the Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] is from AllŒh, the

2.Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book, [O Muúammad ], 
in truth.  So worship All Œh, [being] sincere to Him in religion.
3.Unquestionably, for All Œh is the pure religion.1251  And those who
take protectors besides Him [say], "We only worship them that 
they may bring us nearer to AllŒh in position."  Indeed, AllŒh 
will judge between them concerning that over which they differ.  
Indeed, AllŒh does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] 
disbeliever.
4.If All Œh had i ntended to take a son, He coul d have chosen from 
what He creates whatever He willed.  Exalted is He; He is All Œh,
the One, the Prevailing.
5.He created the heavens and earth in truth.  He wraps the night 
over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected 
the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified 
term.  Unquestionably, He is the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual 
Forgiver.
6.He created you from one soul.  Then He made from it its mate, 
and He produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates .1252  
He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after 
creation, within three darknesses.1253  That is All Œh, your Lord; 
to Him belongs dominion.  There is no deity except Him, so how
are you averted?
7.If you disbelieve –indeed, All Œh is Free from need o f you.  And

456He does not approve for His servants disbelief.  And if you are 
grateful, He approves [i.e., likes] it for you; and no bearer of 
burdens will bear the burden of another.  Then to your Lord is 
your return, and He will inform you about what y ou used to do.   
Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
8.And when adversity touches man, he calls upon his Lord, 
turning to Him [alone]; then when He bestows on him a favor 
from Himself, he forgets Him whom he called upon before,1254
and he attri butes to All Œh equals to mislead [people] from His 
way.  Say, "Enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of 
the companions of the Fire."
9.Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, 
prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and 
hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]?  
Say, "Are those who know equal to those who do not know?"  
Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding.
10.Say,1255"O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord.   
For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of 
AllŒh is spacious.  Indeed, the patient will be given their reward 
without account [i.e., limit]."
11.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Indeed, I have been commanded to 
worship All Œh, [being] sincere to Hi m in religion.
12.And I have been commanded to be the first [among you] of 
the Muslims."
13.Say, "Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment
of a tremendous Day."
14.Say, "All Œh [alone] do I worship, sincere to Him in my religion,
15.Soworship what you will besides Him."  Say, "Indeed, the losers
are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the 
Day of Resurrection.  Unquestionably, that is the manifest loss."

17.But those who have avoided ‹Œgh´t ,1256lest they worship it, 
and turned back to All Œh –for them are good tidings.  So give 
good tidings to My serv ants
18.Who listen to speech and follow the best of it.  Those are the 
ones All Œh has guided, and those are people of understanding.
19.Then, is one who has deserved the decree of punishment [to 
be guided]?  Then, can you save one who is in the Fire?
20.But those who have feared their Lord –for them are chambers,1257
above them chambers built high, beneath which rivers flow.  
[This is] the promise of AllŒh.  AllŒh does not fail in [His] 
promise.
21.Do you not see that AllŒh sends down rain from the sky and 
makes it flow as springs [and rivers] in the earth; then He 
produces thereby crops of varying colors; then they dry and you 
see them turned yellow; then He makes them [scattered] debris.   
Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding.
22.So isone whose breast AllŒh has expanded to [accept] IslŒm 
and he is upon [i.e., guided by] a light from his Lord [like one 
whose heart rejects it]?  Then woe to those whose hearts are 
hardened against the remembrance of AllŒh.  Those are in 
manifest error.
23.AllŒh has sent down the best statement:  a consistent Book 
wherein is reiteration.  The skins shiver therefrom of those 
who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts relax at 
the remembrance [i.e., mention] of All Œh.  That is the guidance
of All Œh by which He guides whom He wills.  And one whom 
AllŒh leaves astray –for him there is no guide.
                                               
1256i.e., Satan or any false object of worship.1257i.e., elevated rooms, dwellings or palaces.

45824.Then is he who will shield with his face1258the worst of the 
punishment on the Day of Resurrection [like one secure from 
it]?  And it will be said to thewrongdoers, "Taste what you 
used to earn."
25.Those before them denied, and punishment came upon them 
from where they did not perceive.
26.So AllŒh made them taste disgrace in worldly life.  But the 
punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only k new.
27.And We have certainly presented for the people in this QurÕ Œn 
from every [kind of] example –that they might remember.
28.[It is] an Arabic QurÕŒn, without any devianc e1259that they might
become righteous.1260
29.AllŒh presents an example:  a man [i.e., slave] owned by 
quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one 
man –are they equal in comparison?  Praise be to All Œh!  But 
most of them do not know.
30.Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die.
31.Then indeed you, on the Da y of Resurrection, before your Lord,
will dispute.
32.So who is more unjust than one who lies about AllŒh and 
denies the truth when it has come to him?  Is there not in Hell 
a residence for the disbelievers?
33.And the one who has brought the truth [i.e. , the Prophet ()] 
and [they who] believed in it –those are the righteous.
34.They will have whatever they desire with their Lord.  That is 
the reward of the doers of good –
35.That All Œh may remove from them the worst of what they did 
and reward them their due for th e best of what they used to do.
                                               
1258Rather than his hands, which will be chained to his neck.1259From the truth.1260Through consciousness of All Œh.

Page 481:
S´rah 39–az-Zumar JuzÕ 24
45936.Is not All Œh sufficient for His Servant [i.e., Prophet Muúammad
()]?  And [yet], they threaten you with those [they worship] 
other than Him.  And whoever AllŒh leaves astray –for him 
there is no guide.
37.And whoever AllŒh guides –for him there is no misleader.  Is 
not All Œh Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?
38.And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and the 
earth?" they would surely say, "All Œh."  Say, "Then have you 
considere d1261what you invoke besides AllŒh?  If AllŒh intended
me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me 
mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?"  Say, "Sufficient 
for me is All Œh; upon Him [alone] rely the [wise] reliers."
39.Say, "O my people, work according to you r position, [for] indeed,
I am working; and you are going to know
40.To whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom 
will descend an enduring punishment."
41.Indeed, We sent down to you the Book for the people in truth.  
So whoever is guided –it is for [the benefit of] his soul; and 
whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment.  And 
you are not a manager [i.e., authority] over them.
42.AllŒh takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that 
do not die [He takes] during their sle ep.  Then He keeps those 
for which He has decreed death and releases the others for a 
specified term.  Indeed in that are signs for a people who give 
thought.
43.Or have they taken other than AllŒh as intercessors?  Say, 
"Even though they do not possess [ power over] anything, nor 
do they reason?"
44.Say, "To All Œh belongs [the right to allow] intercession entirely.   
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.  
Then to Him you will be returned."
                                               
1261i.e., "Tell me about..."

Page 482:
S´rah 39–az-Zumar JuzÕ 24
46045.And when AllŒh is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who 
do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when 
those [worshipped] other than Him are mentioned, immediately
they rejoice.
46.Say, "O AllŒh, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower 
of the unseen and the witnessed, You w ill judge between your 
servants concerning that over which they used to differ."
47.And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely 
and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom 
themselves thereby from the worst of the punish ment on the 
Day of Resurrection.  And there will appear to them from 
AllŒh that which they had not taken into account.1262
48.And there will appear to them the evils they had earned, and 
they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
49.And when adve rsity touches man, he calls upon Us; then when
We bestow on him a favor from Us, he says, "I have only been
given it because of [my] knowledge."  Rather, it is a trial, but 
most of them do not know.
50.Those before them had already said it, but they were not availed
by what they used to earn.
51.And the evil consequences of what they earned struck them.  
And those who have wronged of these [people] will be struck 
[i.e., afflicted] by the evil consequences of what they earned; 
and they will not cause failu re.1263
52.Do they not know that AllŒh extends provision for whom He 
wills and restricts [it]?  Indeed in that are signs for a people 
who believe.
53.Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves
[by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of AllŒh.  Indeed, 
AllŒh forgives all sins.1264  Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, 
the Merciful."
                                               
1262Of His anger and punishment.1263i.e., prevent All Œh from what He wills or escape from the punishment.1264For those who repent and correct themselves.

S´rah 39–az-Zumar JuzÕ 24
46154.And return [in repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him 
before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be 
helped.
55.And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your 
Lord [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] before the punishment comes upon you 
suddenly while you do not perceive,
56.Lest a soul should say,1265"Oh, [how great is] my regret over 
what I neglected in regard to AllŒh and that I was among the 
mockers."
57.Or [lest] it say, "If only AllŒh had guided me, I would have 
been among the righteous."
58.Or [lest] it say when it sees the punishment, "If only I had 
another turn1266so I could be among the doers of good."
59.But yes, there had come to you My verses, but you denied them
and were arrogant, and you were among the disbelievers.
60.And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied 
about All Œh [with] their faces blackened.  Is there not in Hell a 
residence for the arrogant?
61.And All Œh will save those who feared Him by their attainment ;1267
no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.
62.AllŒh is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, 
Disposer of affairs.
63.To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth.  And 
they w ho disbelieve in the verses of All Œh –it is those who are 
the losers.
64.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Is it other than All Œh that you order me 
to worship, O ignorant ones?"
65.And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that 
if you should associat e [anything] with AllŒh, your work would

462surely become worthless, and you wo uld surely be among the 
losers.
66.Rather, worship [only] All Œh and be among the grateful.
67.They have not appraised AllŒh with true appraisal,1268while 
the earth entirely will be[within] His grip1269on the Day of 
Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand .1270  
Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.
68.And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and 
whoever is on the earth will fa ll dead except whom All Œh wills.   
Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, 
looking on.
69.And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record
[of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses 
will be brou ght, and it will be judged between them in truth, 
and they will not be wronged.
70.And every soul will be fully compensated [for] what it did; 
and He is most knowing1271of what they do.
71.And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until,
when they reach it, its gates are opened and its keepers will say,
"Did there not come to you messengers from yourselves, 
reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the 
meeting of this Day of yours?"  They will say, "Yes, but the 
word [i.e., decree] of punishment has come into effect upon 
the disbelievers."
72.[To them] it will be said, "Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally
therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant."
73.But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in 
groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been 
                                               
1268i.e., appreciation of His attributes.1269Literally, "no more than a handful of His."1270See footnote to 2:19.1271With no need for any record or witnesses, which are but means to 
establish proof to the soul itself in addition to its own knowledge of 
what it has done.

463opened and its keepers say, "Peace be upon you; you have 
become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein," [they will 
enter] .1272
74.And they will say, "Praise to AllŒh, who has fulfill ed for us 
His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle 
in Paradise wherever we will.  And excellent is the reward of 
[righteous] workers."
75.And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting 
[AllŒh] with praise of their Lord.  And it will be judged between
them in truth, and it will be said, "[All] praise to AllŒh, Lord 
of the worlds."
                                               
1272In such honor and joy that is beyond description –thus, the omission of 
this conclusion in the Arabic text.

2.The revelation of the Book [i.e., the QurÕŒn] is from AllŒh, the 
Exalted in Might, th e Knowing,
3.The forgiver of sin, acceptor of repentance, severe in punishment,
owner of abundance.  There is no deity except Him; to Him is 
the destination.
4.No one disputes concerning the signs of All Œh except those who 
disbelieve, so be not deceived by their [uninhibited] movement 
throughout the land.
5.The people of Noah denied before them and the [disbelieving] 
factions after them, and every nation intended [a plot] for their 
messenger to seize him, and they disputed by [using] falsehood 
to [attemp t to] invalidate thereby the truth.  So I seized them, 
and how [terrible] was My penalty.
6.And thus has the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord come into effect
upon those who disbelieved that they are companions of the Fire.
7.Those [angels] who carry theThrone and those around it exalt 
[AllŒh] with praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask 
forgiveness for those who have believed, [saying], "Our Lord, 
You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge, so 
forgive those who have repented and followed Your way and 
protect them from the punishment of Hellfire.
8.Our Lord, and admit them to gardens of perpetual residence 
which You have promised them and whoever was righteous 
among their fathers, their spouses and their offspring.  Indeed, it 
is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

4659.And protect them from the evil consequences [of their deeds].  
And he whom You protect from evil consequences that Day –
You will have given him mercy.  And that is the great attainment."
10.Indeed, those who disbelieve will be addressed, "The hatred of
AllŒh for you was [even] greater than your hatred of yourselves
[this Day in Hell] when you were invited to faith, but you 
disbelieved [i.e., refused]."
11.They will say, "Our Lord, You made us lifeless twice and gave
us life twice, and we have confessed our sins.  So is there to 
an exit any way?"
12.[They will be told], "That is because, when All Œh was called upon
alone, you disbelieved; but if others were associated with Him,
you believed.  So the judgement is w ith All Œh, the Most High, 
the Grand."
13.It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you from 
the sky, provision.  But none will remember except he who 
turns back [in repentance].
14.So invoke AllŒh, [being] sincere to Him in religion, although 
the disbelievers dislike it.
15.[He is] the Exalted above [all] degrees, Owner of the Throne; 
He places the inspiration of His command [i.e., revelation] 
upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of 
Meeting.
16.The Day they come forth nothing concerning them will be 
concealed from AllŒh.  To whom belongs [all] sovereignty 
this Day?  To All Œh, the One, the Prevailing.
17.This Day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned.  
No injustice today!  Indeed, All Œh is swift in account.
18.And warn them, [O Muúammad ], of the Approaching Day, 
when hearts are at the throats, filled [with distress].  For the 
wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor 
[who is] obeyed.
19.He knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts 
conceal.

46620.And All Œh judges with truth, while those they invoke besides Him 
judge not with anything.  Indeed, AllŒh –He is the Hearing, 
theSeeing.
21.Have they not traveled through the land and observed how 
was the end of those who were before them?  They were 
greater than them in strength and in impression on the land, 
but AllŒh seized them for their sins.  And they had not from 
AllŒh any protector.
22.That was because their messengers were coming to them with 
clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Al lŒh seized them.  Indeed,
He is Powerful and severe in punishment.
23.And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear 
authority
24.To Pharaoh, HŒmŒn and QŒr´n, but they said, "[He is] a 
magician and a liar."
25.And when he brought them the tr uth from Us, they said, "Kill 
the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their 
women alive."  But the plan of the disbelievers is not except in 
error.
26.And Pharaoh said, "Let me kill Moses and let him call upon 
his Lord.  Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or 
that he will cause corruption1275in the land."
27.But Moses said, "Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and 
your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in 
the Day of Account."
28.And a believing man from the fa mily of Pharaoh who concealed
his faith said, "Do you kill a man [merely] because he says, 
'My Lord is All Œh' while he has brought you clear proofs from 
your Lord?  And if he should be lying, then upon him is [the 
consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will 
strike you some of what he promises you.  Indeed, All Œh does 
not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar.
                                               
1275i.e., dissension or civil strife.

46729.O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant
in the land.  But who would protect us from the punishme nt of 
AllŒh if it came to us?"  Pharaoh said, "I do not show you 
except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of 
right conduct."
30.And he who believed said, "O my people, indeed I fear for 
you [a fate] like the day of the companies1276–
31.Like the custom of the people of Noah and of ÔAad and Tham´d
and those after them.  And AllŒh wants no injustice for [His] 
servants.
32.And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling1277–
33.The Day you will turn your backs fleeing; there is not for you 
from All Œh any protector.  And whoever All Œh leaves astray –
there is not for him any guide.
34.And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, 
but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until 
when he died, you said, 'Never will AllŒh send a messenger after
him.'  Thus does AllŒh leave astray he who is a transgressor 
and skeptic."
35.Those who dispute concerning the signs of AllŒh without an 
authority having come to them –great is hatred [of them] in 
the sight of All Œh and in the sight of those who have believed.  
Thus does All Œh seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant
tyrant.
36.And Pharaoh said, "O HŒmŒn, construct for me a tower that I 
might reach the ways1278–
37.The ways into the heavens –so that I may look at the deity of 
Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar."  And thus was made 
                                               
1276i.e., the days on which AllŒh sent His punishment upon those who 
rejected their prophets in former times.1277i.e., the Day of Judgement, when the criminals will cry out in terror, the 
people will ca ll to each other (see 7:44-51), and the angels will call out 
the results of each person's judgement.1278Means of ascent, pathways.

468attractive to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted 
from the [right] way.  And the plan of Pharaoh was not except 
in ruin.
38.And he who believed said, "O my peop le, follow me; I will 
guide you to the way of right conduct.
39.O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, 
and indeed, the Hereafter –that is the home of [permanent] 
settlement.
40.Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed exc ept by 
the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male 
or female, while he is a believer –those will enter Paradise,
being given provision therein without account.
41.And O my people, how is it that I invite you to salvation while 
you invi te me to the Fire? 
42.You invite me to disbelieve in AllŒh and associate with Him 
that of which I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the 
Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.
43.Assuredly, that to which you invite me has no [response to a] 
suppl ication in this world or in the Hereafter; and indeed, our 
return is to AllŒh, and indeed, the transgressors will be 
companions of the Fire.
44.And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust 
my affair to All Œh.  Indeed, All Œh is Seeing of [H is] servants."
45.So AllŒh protected him from the evils they plotted, and the 
people of Pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment –
46.The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening.1279  And 
the Day the Hour appears [it will be said], "Make the people 
of Pharaoh enter the severest punishment."
47.And [mention] when they will argue within the Fire, and the 
weak will say to those who had been arrogant, "Indeed, we 
                                               
1279From the time of their death until the Day of Resurrection, when they 
will be driven into it.

S´rah 40–GhŒfir JuzÕ 24
469were [only] your followers, so will you relieve us of a share of 
the Fire?"
48.Those who had been arrogant will say, "Indeed, all [of us] are 
in it.  Indeed, All Œh has judged between the servants."
49.And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, "Supplicate 
your Lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment."
50.They will say, "Did there not come to you your messengers 
with clear proofs?"  They will say, "Yes."  They will reply, 
"Then supplicate [yourselves], but the supplication of the 
disbelievers is not except in error [i.e., futility]."
51.Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who 
believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the 
witnesses will stand –
52.The Day their excuse will not benefit the wrongdoers, and 
they will have the curse, and they will have the worst home 
[i.e., Hell].
53.And We had certainly given Moses guidance, and We caused 
the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture
54.As guidance and a reminder for those of understanding.
55.So be patient, [O Muúammad ].  Indeed, the promise of AllŒh 
is truth.  And ask forgiveness fo r your sin1280and exalt [All Œh] 
with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.
56.Indeed, those who dispute concerning the signs of All Œh without
[any] authority having come to them –there is not within their 
breasts except pride, [the extent of]which they cannot reach.  
So seek refuge in All Œh.  Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, 
the Seeing.
57.The creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation
of mankind, but most of the people do not know.
                                               
1280What is intended is "fault" or "error" in judgement, since all prophets 
were protected by All Œh from falling into sin.  The implication is that all 
believers should seek forgiveness for their sins.

47058.And not equal are the blind and the seeing, nor are those who 
believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer.  Little do you 
remember.
59.Indeed, the Hour is coming –no doubt about it –but most of 
the people do not believe.
60.And your Lord says, "Call upon Me; I will respond to you."  
Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] 
contemptible.
61.It is A llŒh who made for you the night that you may rest 
therein and the day giving sight.1281  Indeed, AllŒh is full of 
bounty to the people, but most of the people are no t grateful.
62.That is All Œh, your Lord, Creator of all things; t here is no deity
except Him, so how are you deluded?
63.Thus were those [before you] deluded who were rejecting the 
signs of All Œh.
64.It is All Œh who made for you the earth a place of set tlement and
the sky a structure [i.e., ceiling] and formed you and perfected 
your forms and provided you with good things.  That is All Œh, 
your Lord; then blessed is All Œh, Lord of the worlds.
65.He is the Ever -Living; t here is no deity except Him, s o cal l upon
Him, [being] sincere to Him in religion.  [All] praise is [due] 
to All Œh, Lord of the worlds.
66.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship
those you call upon besides AllŒh once the clear proofs have 
come to me from my Lord, and I have been commanded to 
submit to the Lord of the worlds."
67.It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm -drop, 
then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; 
then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, 
then [further] that you become elders.  And among you is he 
who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified
term;1282and perhaps you will use reason.
                                               
1281i.e., making things visible.1282The time decreed for your death.

47168.He it is who gives life and causes death; and when He decrees 
a matter, He but says to it, " Be," and it is.
69.Do you not consider those who dispute concerning the signs 
of All Œh –how are they averted?
70.Those who deny the Book [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] and that with which
We sent Our messengers –they are going to know,
71.When the shackles are ar ound their necks and the chains; they 
will be dragged
72.In boiling water; then in the Fire they will be filled [with flame].
73.Then it will be said to them, "Where is that which you used to 
associate [with Him in worship]
74.Other than All Œh?"  They w ill say, "They have departed from 
us;rather, we did not used to invoke previously anything."  
Thus does All Œh put astray the disbelievers.
75.[The angels will say], "That was because you used to exult upon
the earth without right and you used to behave i nsolently.
76.Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched 
is the residence of the arrogant."
77.So be patient, [O Muúammad ]; indeed, the promise of All Œh is 
truth.  And whether We show you some of what We have 
promised them or We take you in death, it is to Us they will 
be returned.
78.And We have already sent messengers before you.  Among 
them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and 
among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to 
you.  And it was not for an y messenger to bring a sign [or verse] 
except by permission of All Œh.  So when the command of All Œh
comes, it will be concluded [i.e., judged] in truth, and the falsifiers
will thereupon lose [all].
79.It is All Œh who made for you the grazing animals upon which 
you ride, and some of them you eat.
80.And for you therein are [other] benefits and that you may

472realize upon them a need which is in your breasts;1283and 
upon them and upon ships you are carried.
81.And He shows you His signs.  So which of the sign s of All Œh 
do you deny?
82.Have they not traveled through the land and observed how 
was the end of those before them?  They were more numerous 
than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on 
the land, but they were not availed by what they us ed to earn.
83.And when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, 
they [merely] rejoiced in what they had of knowledge, but 
they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
84.And when they saw Our punishment, they said, "We believe in 
AllŒh alo ne and disbelieve in that which we used to associate
with Him."
85.But never did their faith benefit them once they saw Our 
punishment.  [It is] the established way of AllŒh which has 
preceded among His servants.  And the disbelievers thereupon 
lost [all] .

3.A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic QurÕ Œn1286
for a people who know,
4.As a giver of good tidin gs and a warner; but most of them turn 
away, so they do not hear.
5.And they say, "Our hearts are within coverings [i.e., screened] 
from that to which you invite us, and in our ears is deafness, 
and between us and you is a partition, so work;1287indeed, we
are working."
6.Say, [O Muúammad ], "I am only a man like you to whom it 
has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a 
straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness."  And woe to 
those who associate others with All Œh –
7.Those who do not give zakŒh, and in the Hereafter they are 
disbelievers.
8.Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds –for them 
is a reward uninterrupted.
9.Say, "Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in 
two days and attribute to Him equals?  That is the Lord of the 
worlds."
10.And He placed on it [i.e., the earth] firmly set mountains

11.Then He directed Himsel f1289to the heaven while it was smoke 
and said to it and to the earth, "Come [into being],1290willingly 
or by compulsion."  They said, "We have come willingly."
12.And He completed them as seven heavens within two days 
and inspir ed [i.e., made known] in each heaven its command.  
And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars, for 
beauty] and as protection.1291  That is the determination of the 
Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
13.But if they turn away, then say, "I have warn ed you of a
thunderbolt like the thunderbolt [that struck] ÔAad and Tham´d.
14.[That occurred] when the messengers had come to them before
them and after them, [saying], "Worship not except AllŒh."  
They said, "If our Lord had willed,1292He would have sent 
down the angels, so indeed we, in that with which you have 
been sent, are disbelievers."
15.As for ÔAad, they were arrogant upon the earth without right 
and said, "Who is greater than us in strength?"  Did they not 
consider that All Œh who created them was greater than them in 
strength?  But they were rejecting Our signs.
16.So We sent upon them a screaming wind during days of 
misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in 
the worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more 
disgracin g, and they will not be helped.
17.And as for Tham´d, We guided them, but they preferred blindness
over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment 
seized them for what they used to earn.
18.And We saved those who believed and used to fear All Œh.

47519.And [mention, O Muúammad ], the Day when the enemies of 
AllŒh will be gathered to the Fire while they are [driven], 
assembled in rows,
20.Until, when they reach it, their hearing and their eyes and their 
skins will testify against them of what they used to do.
21.And they will say to their skins, "Why have you testified against
us?"  They will say, "We were made to speak by AllŒh, who 
has made everything speak; and He created you the first time, 
and to Him you are returned.
22.And you were not covering [i.e., protecting] yourselves,1293
lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins,
but you assumed that All Œh does not know much of what you do.
23.And that was your assumption which you assumed about your 
Lord.  It has brought you t o ruin, and you have become among 
the losers."
24.So [even] if they are patient, the Fire is a residence for them; 
and if they ask to appease [AllŒh], they will not be of those 
who are allowed to appease.
25.And We appointed for them companions1294who made
attractive to them what was before them and what was behind 
them [of sin], and the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect 
upon them among nations which had passed on before them of 
jinn and men.  Indeed, they [all] were losers.
26.And those who disbeli eve say, "Do not listen to this QurÕŒn 
and speak noisily1295during [the recitation of] it that perhaps 
you will overcome."
27.But We will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a 
severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for 
the worst of wha t they had been doing.
                                               
1293With righteousness or by fearing All Œh.1294In this world among the evil jinnand men.1295Other meanings include "speak improperly" and/or "make a clamor."  
The purpose of this was to prevent the hearing or understanding of the 
QurÕŒn.

47628.That is the recompense of the enemies of AllŒh –the Fire.  
For them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for 
what they, of Our verses, were rejecting.
29.And those who disbelieved will [then] say, "Our Lord, show 
us those who misled us of the jinn and men [so] we may put 
them under our feet1296that they will be among the lowest."
30.Indeed, those who have said, "Our Lord is All Œh" and then
remained on a right course –the angels will descend upon them, 
[saying], "Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings
of Paradise, which you were promised.
31.We [angels] were your allies in worldly life and [are so] in the 
Hereafter.  And you will have therein whatever your souls 
desire, and you will have therein whatever you request [or wish]
32.As accommodation from a [Lord who is] Forgiving and 
Merciful."
33.And who is better in speech than one who invites to All Œh and 
does righteousness and says, "Indeed, I am of the Muslims."
34.And not equal are the good deed and t he bad.  Repel [evil] by 
that [deed] which is better; and thereupon, the one whom 
between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he 
was a devoted friend.
35.But none is granted it except those who are patient, and none 
is granted it except one havi ng a great portion [of good].
36.And if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then 
seek refuge in All Œh.  Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
37.And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon.  
Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to All Œh, 
who created them, if it should be Him that you worship.1297
38.But if they are arrogant –then those who are near your Lord 
                                               
1296In the lowest d epths of Hell.  Or "that we may step on them" in revenge.1297i.e., Do not worship All Œh through His creations but worship Him directly
and exclusively.

477[i.e., the angels] exalt Him by night and by day, and they do 
not become weary.
39.And of His si gns is that you see the earth stilled, but when We 
send down upon it rain, it quivers and grows.  Indeed, He who 
has given it life is the Giver of Life to the dead.  Indeed, He is 
over all things competent.
40.Indeed, those who inject deviation into Our verses1298are not 
concealed from Us.  So, is he who is cast into the Fire better 
or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection?  Do 
whatever you will; indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.
41.Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message [i.e., the QurÕ Œn]1299
after it has come to them...1300  And indeed, it is a mi ghty1301
Book.
42.Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; 
[it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy.
43.Nothing is said to you, [O Muúammad ], except what was 
already said to the messengers before you.  Indeed, your Lord 
is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty.
44.And if We had made it a foreign [i.e., non-Arabic] QurÕŒn, 
they would have said, "Why are its verses not explained in 
detail [in our language]?  Is it a foreign [recitation] and an 
Arab [messenger]?"  Say, "It is, for those who believe, a 
guidance and cure."  And those who do not believe –in their 
ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness.  Those are 
being called from a distant place.1302
45.And We had already given Moses the Scripture, but it came 
under disagreement.1303  And if not for a word [i.e., decree]1304

punishment."1301Inimitable, resistant to attack, protected by All Œh.1302For all practical purposes, since they neither hear nor understand.1303An alternative meaning is "he was opposed over it."1304See footnote to 10:19 .

478that preceded from your Lord, it would have been concluded 
between them.  And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the 
QurÕŒn], in disquieting doubt.
46.Whoever does righteousness –it is for his [own] soul; and 
whoever does evil [does so] against it.  And your Lord is not 
ever unjust to [His] servants.
47.To Him [alone] is attributed knowledge of the Hour.  And fru its 
emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive 
or give birth except with His knowledge.  And the Day He 
will call to them, "Where are My 'partners'?" they will say, 
"We announce to You that there is [no longer] among us any 
witness [to that ]."
48.And lost from them will be those they were invoking before, 
and they will be certain that they have no place of escape.
49.Man is not weary of supplication for good [things], but if evil 
touches him, he is hopeless and despairing.
50.And if We le t him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which
has touched him, he will surely say, "This is [due] to me,1305
and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should 
be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him 
the best."  But We will surely inform those who disbelieved 
about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a 
massive punishment.
51.And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and 
distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of 
extensive suppli cation.
52.Say, "Have you considered:  if it [i.e., the QurÕŒn] is from 
AllŒh and you disbelieved in it, who would be more astray 
than one who is in extreme dissension?"
53.We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within
themselves until it become s clear to them that it is the truth.1306

11.[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth.  He has made for 
you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He 
multiplies you thereby .  There is nothing like unto Him,1313
and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
12.To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth.  He 
extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it].  Indeed 
He is, of all things, Knowing.
13.He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon 
Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muúammad ], 
and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus –
to establish the religion and not be divided therein.  Difficult 
for those who associate others with All Œh is that to which you 
invite them.  AllŒh chooses for Himself whom He wills and 
guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].
14.And they did not become divided until after knowledge had 
come to them –out of jealous animosity between themselves.  
And if not for a word1314that preceded from your Lord

remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not

There is no [need for] argument between us and you.1317  AllŒh 
will bring us together, and to Him is the [final] destination."
16.And those who argue concerning AllŒh after He has been 
responded to1318–their argument is invalid with their Lord, and 
upon them is [His] wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.
17.It is All Œh who has sent down the Book in truth and [also] the 
balance [i.e., justice].  Andwhat will make you perceive?  
Perhaps the Hour is near.
18.Those who do not believe in it are impatient for it,1319but 
those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth.  
Unquestionably, those who dispute concerning the Hour are in 
extreme error.
19.AllŒh is Subtle [i.e., gentle] with His servants; He gives provision 
to whom He wills.  And He is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.
20.Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter –We increase 
for him in his harvest [i.e., reward].  And whoe ver desires the 
harvest [i.e., benefits] of this world –We give him thereof, but 
there is not for him in the Hereafter any share.
21.Or have they partners [i.e., other deities] who have ordained 
for them a religion to which AllŒh has not consented?  But if 
not for the decisive word,1320it would have been concluded 
between them.  And indeed, the wrongdoers will have a painful 
punishment.
22.You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned, 
and it will [certainly] befall them.  And those who have believed
and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens
                                               
1316i.e., the consequences thereof.1317Since the truth has been made clear and since those who refuse it do so 
only out of stub bornness or worldly interests.1318i.e., after people have accepted the truth from AllŒh, in an attempt to 
turn the believers away from His religion of Isl Œm.1319They had challenged the Prophet ( ) to bring it on immediately.1320Decree .  See footnote to 10:19 .

483[in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of 
their Lord.  That is what is the great bounty.
23.It is that of which AllŒh gives good tidings to His servants 
who believe and do righteous deeds.  Say, [O Muúammad ], "I 
do not ask you for it [i.e., this message] any payment [but] 
only good will through [i.e., due to] kinship."  And whoever 
commits a good deed –We will increase for him good therein.  
Indeed, All Œh is Forgivi ng and Appreciative.
24.Or do they say, "He has invented about AllŒh a lie"?  But if 
AllŒh willed, He could seal over your heart.1321  And AllŒh 
eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words.  
Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
25.And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and 
pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.
26.And He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed 
and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His 
bounty.  But the disbelieve rs will have a severe punishment.
27.And if AllŒh had extended [excessively] provision for His 
servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the 
earth.  But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills.  
Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainte d and Seeing.
28.And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and 
spreads His mercy.  And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy.
29.And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and 
what He has dispersed throughout them of cr eatures.  And He, 
for gathering them when He wills, is competent.
30.And whatever strikes you of disaster –it is for what your hands
have earned; but He pardons much.
31.And you will not cause failure [to AllŒh]1322upon the earth.  
And you have not beside s All Œh any protector or helper.

48432.And of His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains.
33.If He willed, He could still the wind, and they would remain
motionless on its surface.  Indeed in that are signs for everyone
patient and grateful.
34.Or He could destroy them1323for what they earned; but He 
pardons much.
35.And [that is so] those who dispute concerning Our signs may 
know that for them there is no place of escape.
36.So whatever thing you have been given –it is but [for] 
enjoyment of the w orldly life.  But what is with All Œh is better 
and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their 
Lord rely
37.And those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, and 
when they are angry, they forgive,
38.And those who have responded to their Lord and established 
prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among 
themselves, and from what We have provided them, they spend,
39.And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend 
themselves.1324
40.And the retribution for an evil act isan evil one like it, but 
whoever pardons and makes reconciliation –his reward is 
[due] from All Œh.  Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers.
41.And whoever avenges himself after having been wronged –
those have not upon them any cause [for blame].
42.The c ause is only against the ones who wrong the people and 
tyrannize upon the earth without right.  Those will have a 
painful punishment.
43.And whoever is patient and forgives –indeed, that is of the 
matters [ worthy] of resolve .1325
                                               
1323Meaning that All Œh could sink the ships by means of violent winds.1324Or avenge themselves in a just manner, restoring their rights and not 
allowing aggressors to take advantage of them out of weakness.1325On the part of those seeking the reward of All Œh.

48544.And he whom All Œh sends astray –for him there is no protector 
beyond Him.  And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see 
the punishment, saying, "Is there for return [to the former world]
any way?"
45.And you will see them being exposed to it [i.e., the Fire], 
humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert 
glance.  And those who had believed will say, "Indeed, the
[true] losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families 
on the Day of Resurrection.  Unquestionably, the wrongdoers 
are in an enduring punishment ."
46.And there will not be for them any allies to aid them other 
than All Œh.  And whoever All Œh sends astray –for him there is 
no way.
47.Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from AllŒh of 
which there is no repelling.  No refuge will you have that D ay, 
nor for you will there be any denial.1326
48.But if they turn away –then We have not sent you, [O 
Muúammad ], over them as a guardian; upon you is only [the 
duty of] notification.  And indeed, when We let man taste 
mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but if evil afflicts him for 
what his hands have put forth, then indeed, man is ungrateful.
49.To AllŒh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; 
He creates what He wills.  He gives to whom He wills female 
[children], and He gives to whom He wills mal es.
50.Or He makes them [both] males and females, and He renders 
whom He wills barren.  Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent.
51.And it is not for any human being that AllŒh should speak to 
him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He 
sends a messenger [i.e., angel] to reveal, by His permission, 
what He wills.  Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.
52.And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our 
                                               
1326Of your sins or "disapproval" of your punishment.

We guide whom We will of Our servants.  And indeed, [O 
Muúammad ], you guide to a straight path –
53.The path of All Œh, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens
and whatever is on the earth.  Unquestionably, to AllŒh do 
[all] matters evolve [i.e., return].

remember the favor of your Lord when you have settled upon 
them and say, "Exalted is He who has subjected this to us, and 
we could not have [otherwise] subdued it.1332
14.And indeed we, to our Lord, will [surely] return."
15.But they have attributed to Him from His servants a portion .1333  
Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful.
16.Or has He taken, out of what He has created, daughters and 
chosen you for [having] sons?
17.And when one of them is given good tidings of that which he 
attributes to the Most Merciful in comparison [i.e., a daughter],
his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.
18.So is one brought up in ornaments while being during conflict 
unevident1334[attributed to All Œh]?
19.And they have made the angels, who are servants of the Most 
Merciful, females.  Did they witness their creation?  Their 
testimony will be record ed, and they will be questioned.
20.And they said, "If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not 
have worshipped them."  They have of that no knowledge.  
They are not but falsifying.
21.Or have We given them a book before it [i.e., the QurÕŒn] to 
which they are adhering?
22.Rather, they say, "Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion,
and we are in their footsteps [rightly] guided."
23.And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a 
city except that its affluent said, "Indeed, we found o ur fathers 
upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following."
                                               
1332Literally, "made it a companion" or "made it compatible."1333By claiming that He ( subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) has a son or daughters, as it 
is said that a child is part of his parent.  This concept is totally incompatible
with All Œh's unity and exclusiveness.1334Not "obvious" or "distinct" in an argument.  Or not "seen," i.e., absent 
from battles.  The reference is to a daughter.

48924.[Each warner] said, "Even if I brought you better guidance 
than that [religion] upon which you found your fathers?"  
They said, "Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are 
disbelievers."
25.So We took retribution from them; then see how was the end 
of the deniers.
26.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Abraham said to his father
and his people, "Indeed, I am disassociated from that which 
you worship
27.Except for He who created me; and indeed, He will guide me."
28.And he made it1335a word remaining among his descendants 
that they might return [to it].
29.However, I gave enjoyment to these [people of Makkah] and 
their fathers1336until there came to them the truth and a clear 
Messe nger.1337
30.But when the truth came to them, they said, "This is magic,  
and indeed we are, concerning it, disbelievers."
31.And they said, "Why was this QurÕŒn not sent down upon a 
great man from [one of] the two cities?"1338
32.Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord?  It is We who have 
apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this 
world and have raised some of them above others in degrees 
[of rank] that they may make use of one another for service.  
But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they 
accumulate.
33.And if it were not that the people would become one 
community [of disbelievers],1339We would have made for 
                                               
1335i.e., his testimony that none is worthy of worship except All Œh.1336The descendants of Abraham.1337i.e., one who is obvious with a clear m essage, meaning Muúammad ().1338Referring to Makkah and a‹ -$ŒÕif.1339Who assumed that All Œh's generosity to them was a sign of His approval 
or who would hasten to disbelief in order to obtain wealth.

490those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful –for their houses –
ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount
34.And for their houses –doors and couches [of silver] upon 
which to recline
35.And gold ornament.  But all that is not but the enjoyment of 
worldly life.  And the Hereafter with your Lord is for the 
righteous.
36.And whoever is blinded from remembrance of the Most 
Merciful –We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a 
companion.
37.And indeed, they [i.e., the devils] avert them from the way [of 
guidance] while they think that they are [rightly] guided
38.Until, when he comes to Us [at Judgement], he says [to his 
companion], "Oh, I wish there was between me and you the
distance between the east and west –how wretched a companion."
39.And never will it benefit you that Day, when you have wronged,
that you are [all] sharing in the punishment.
40.Then will you make the deaf hear, [O Muúammad ], or guide 
the blind or he who is in clear error?
41.And whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, 
We will take retribution upon them.
42.Or whether [or not] We show you that which We have promised
them, indeed, We are Perfect in Ability.
43.So adhere to that which is revealed to you.  Indeed, you are on 
a straight path.
44.And indeed, it is a remembrance1340for you and your people, 
and you [all] are going to be questioned.
45.And ask those We sent befor e you of Our messengers; have 
We made besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?
46.And certainly did We send Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh
                                               
1340i.e., an honor.  Or "a reminder."

491and his establishment, and he said, "Indeed, I am the messenger
of the Lord of the worlds."
47.But when he brought them Our signs, at once they laughed at 
them.
48.And We showed them not a sign except that it was greater 
than its sister, and We seized them with affliction that perhaps 
they might return [to faith].
49.And they said [to Moses], "O magician, invoke for us your Lord 
by what He has promised you.  Indeed, we will be guided."
50.But when We removed from them the affliction, at once they 
broke their word.
51.And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, "O my people,
does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers 
flowing beneath me; then do you not see?
52.Or am I [not] better than this one [i.e., Moses] who is insignificant
and hardly makes himself clear?1341
53.Then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of 
gold or c ome with him the angels in conjunction?"
54.So he bluffed his people, and they obeyed him.  Indeed, they 
were [themselves] a people defiantly disobedient [of All Œh].
55.And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them 
and drowned them all.
56.And We made them a precedent and an example for the later 
peoples.
57.And when the son of Mary was presented as an example,1342
immediately your people laughed aloud.
58.And they said, "Are our gods better, or is he?"1343  They did 
not present it [i.e., the compa rison] except for [mere] argument .  
But, [in fact], they are a people prone to dispute.
                                               
1341That was true previous to his appointment as a prophet, at which time 
AllŒh corrected his speech impediment.1342Of a creation of All Œh which is being worshipped along with Him.1343Implying that they must all be the same.

49259.He [i.e., Jesus] was not but a servant upon whom We bestowed 
favor, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.
60.And if We willed, We could have made [instead] of you angels
succeeding [one another]1344on the earth.
61.And indeed, he [i.e., Jesus] will be [a sign for] knowledge of 
the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me.1345  This is a 
straight path.
62.And never let Satan avert you.  Indeed, he is to you a clear 
enemy.
63.And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, "I have come to 
you with wisdom [i.e., prophethood] and to make clear to you 
some of that over which you differ, so fear All Œh and obey me.
64.Indeed, AllŒh is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  
This is a straight path."
65.But the denominations from among them differed [and separated],
so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a 
painful Day.
66.Are they waiting except for the Hour to come upon them 
suddenly whi le they perceive not?
67.Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except 
for the righteous
68.[To whom All Œh will say], "O My servants, no fear will there 
be concerning you this Day, nor will you grieve,
69.[You] who believed in Our verse s and were Muslims.
70.Enter Paradise, you and your kinds,1346delighted."
71.Circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold.  
And therein is whatever the souls desire and [what] delights 
the eyes, and you will abide therein eternally.
                                               
1344Or "succeeding [you]."1345i.e., follow the guidance and instruction of All Œh.1346i.e., those like you.  Another meaning may be "your spouses," i.e., the 
righteous among them.

49372.And that is Paradise which you are made to inherit for what 
you used to do.
73.For you therein is much fruit1347from which you will eat.
74.Indeed, the criminals will be in the punishment of Hell, abiding
eternally.
75.It will not be allowed to subside for them, and they, therein, 
are in despair.
76.And We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the 
wrongdoers.
77.And they will call, "O MŒlik,1348let your Lord put an end to 
us!"  He will say, "Indeed, you will remain."
78.We had certainly brought you the truth, but most of you, to 
the truth, were averse.
79.Or have they devised [some] affair?1349  But indeed, We are 
devising [a plan].
80.Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their 
private conversations?  Yes, [We do], and Our messengers 
[i.e., a ngels] are with them recording.
81.Say, [O Muúammad ], "If the Most Merciful had a son, then I 
would be the first of [his] worshippers."1350
82.Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of the 
Throne, above what they describe.
83.So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until 
they meet their Day which they are promised.
84.And it is He [i.e., All Œh] who is [the only] deity in the heaven, 
and on the earth [the only] deity.  And He is the Wise, the 
Knowing.

49485.And blessed is H e to whom belongs the dominion of the 
heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with 
whom is knowledge of the Hour and to whom you will be 
returned.
86.And those they invoke besides Him do not possess [power of] 
intercession; but only those who tes tify to the truth [can benefit],
and they know.1351
87.And if you asked them1352who created them, they would 
surely say, "All Œh."  So how are they deluded?
88.And [All Œh acknowledges] his saying,1353"O my Lord, indeed 
these are a people who do not believe."
89.So turn aside from them and say, "Peace."1354  But they are 
going to know.

nature.

50012.It is All Œh who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail 
upon it by His command and that you may seek of His bounty;
and perhaps you will be grateful.
13.And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and 
whatever is on the earth –all from Him.  Indeed in that are 
signs for a people who give thought.
14.Say, [O Muúammad ], to those who have believed that they 
[should] forgive those who expect not the days of AllŒh [i.e., 
of His retributio n] so that He may recompense a people1368for 
what they used to earn.
15.Whoever does a good deed –it is for himself; and whoever 
does evil –it is against it [i.e., the self or soul].  Then to your 
Lord you will be returned.
16.And We did certainly give t he Children of Israel the Scripture 
and judgement1369and prophethood, and We provided them 
with good things and preferred them over the worlds.
17.And We gave them clear proofs of the matter [of religion].  
And they did not differ except after knowledge hadcome to 
them –out of jealous animosity between themselves.  Indeed, 
your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection
concerning that over which they used to differ.
18.Then We put you, [O Muúammad ], on an ordained way 
concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not 
follow the inclinations of those who do not know.
19.Indeed, they will never avail you against All Œh at all.  And indeed,
the wrongdoers are allies of one another; but All Œh is the protector
of the righteous.
20.This [QurÕ Œn] is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and 
mercy for a people who are certain [in faith].
                                               
1368In the Hereafter, where those who forgive will be rewarded and those 
who earned evil will be punished.  This was at the outset of daÔwah
(invitation to All Œh) before permission for jihŒd.1369Understanding of the law.

50121.Or do those who commit evils think We will make them like 
those who have believed and done righteous deeds –[make them]
equal in their life and their death?1370  Evil is that which they 
judge [i.e., assume].
22.And AllŒh created the heavens and earth in truth and so that 
every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned, and 
they will not be wronged.
23.Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, 
and All Œh has sent him astray due to knowledge1371and has set 
a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a 
veil?  So who will guide him after AllŒh?  Then will you not 
be reminded?
24.And they say, "There is not but our worldly life; we die and 
live,1372and nothing destroys us except time."  And they have 
of that no knowledge; they are only assuming.
25.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
their argument is only that they say, "Bring [back] our forefathe rs,
if you should be truthful."
26.Say, "All Œh causes you to live, then causes you to die; then He 
will assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which 
there is no doubt, but most of the people do not know."
27.And to All Œh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.   
And the Day the Hour appears –that Day the falsifiers will lose.
28.And you will see every nation kneeling [from fear].  Every 
nation will be called to its record [and told], "Today you will 
be recompensed for what you used to do.
29.This, Our record, speaks about you in truth.  Indeed, We were 
                                               
1370Another meaning is "...[the evildoers being] equal in their life and their 
death," i.e., unresponsive to guidance.1371This can refer to All Œh's knowledge of th at person and of his preference 
for his own inclinations or to that person's knowledge of the truth while 
he refuses it.1372i.e., some people die and others live, replacing them.

502having transcribed1373whatever you used to do."
30.So as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their 
Lord will admit them into His mercy.  That is what is the clear 
attainment.
31.But as for those who disbelieved, [it will be said], "Were not 
Our verses recited to you, but you were arrogant and became a 
people of criminals?
32.And when it was said, 'Indeed, the promise of AllŒh is truth 
and the Hour [is coming] –no doubt abou t it,' you said, 'We 
know not what is the Hour.  We assume only assumption, and 
we are not convinced. '"
33.And the evil consequences of what they did will appear to them,
and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
34.And it will be said, "Today We will forget you as you forgot 
the meeting of this Day of yours, and your refuge is the Fire, 
and for you there are no helpers.
35.That is because you took the verses of AllŒh in ridicule, and
worldly life deluded you."  So that Day they will not be removed
from it, nor will they be asked to appease [All Œh].
36.Then, to All Œh belongs [all] praise –Lord of the heavens and 
Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds.
37.And to Him belongs [all] grandeur within the heavens and the 
earth, and He is the Ex alted in Might, the Wise.

2.The revelation of the Book is from All Œh, the Exalted in Might, 
the Wise.
3.We did not create the heavens and earth and what is between 
them except in truth and [for] a specified term.  But those who
disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turning away.
4.Say, [O Muúammad ], "Have you considered that which you 
invoke besides AllŒh?  Show me what they have created of the 
earth; or did they have partnership in [creation of] the heavens?  
Bring me a scripture [revealed] before this or a [remaining] 
trace of knowledge, if you should be truthful."
5.And who is more astray than he who invokes besides AllŒh 
those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurre ction 
[i.e., never], and they, of their invocation, are unaware.
6.And when the people are gathered [that Day], they [who were 
invoked] will be enemies to them, and they will be deniers of 
their worship.
7.And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, 
those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, 
"This is obvious magic."
8.Or do they say, "He has invented it"?  Say, "If I have invented it,
you will not possess for me [the power of protection] from All Œh
at all.  He is most knowing of that in which you are involved.1376  
Sufficient is He as Witness between me and you, and He is the 
Forgiving, the Merciful."

nor do I know what will be done with me or with you.  I only 
follow that which is revealed to me, and I am not but a clear 
warner."
10.Say, "Have you considered:  if it [i.e., the QurÕ Œn] was from All Œh, 
and you disbelieved in it while a witness from the Children of 
Israel has testified to something similar1378and be lieved while 
you were arrogant...?"1379  Indeed, AllŒh does not guide the 
wrongdoing people.
11.And those who disbelieve say of those who believe, "If it had 
[truly] been good, they would not have preceded us to it."  And
when they are not guided by it, they will say, "This is an ancient
falsehood."
12.And before it was the scripture of Moses to lead and as a mercy.   
And this is a confirming Book in an Arabic tongue to warn those 
who have wronged and as good tidings to the doers of good.
13.Indeed, those who have said, "Our Lord is All Œh," and then 
remained on a right course –there will be no fear concerning 
them, nor will they grieve.
14.Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein
as reward for what they used to do.
15.And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment.   
His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him 
with hardship, and his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty 
months.  [He grows] until, when he reaches maturity and reaches
[the age of] forty years, he says, "My Lord, enable me1380to 
be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me 
and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You 
                                               
1377i.e., I am neither the first messenger to be sent, nor do I bring something 
different from the other messengers.1378Based upon information from the Torah.1379The conclusion is estimated to be "...would you not then be the most 
unjust of people?" or "...in what condition would you then be?"1380Literally, "gather within me the utmost strength and ability."

505will approve and make righteous for me my offspring.  Indeed, I 
have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims."
16.Those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what
they did and overlook their misdeeds, [their being] among the 
companions of Paradise.  [That is] the promise of truth which 
they had been promised.
17.But one who says t o his parents, "Uf f1381to you; do you promise 
me that I will be brought forth [from the earth] when generations
before me have already passed on [into oblivion]?" while they
call to All Œh for help [and to their son], "Woe to you!  Believe!   
Indeed, the promi se of AllŒh is truth."  But he says, "This is 
not but legends of the former peoples" –
18.Those are the ones upon whom the word [i.e., decree] has come
into effect, [who will be] among nations which had passed on 
before them of jinn and men.  Indeed, they [all] were losers.
19.And for all there are degrees [of reward and punishment] for 
what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fully
compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.
20.And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to t he Fire [it 
will be said], "You exhausted your pleasures during your 
worldly life and enjoyed them, so this Day you will be awarded
the punishment of [extreme] humiliation because you were 
arrogant upon the earth without right and because you were 
defiantl y disobedient."
21.And mention, [O Muúammad ], the brother of ÔAad,1382when 
he warned his people in [the region of] al -AúqŒf –and warners 
had already passed on before him and after him –[saying], 
"Do not worship except AllŒh.  Indeed, I fear for you the 
punishment of a terrible day."1383
                                               
1381An expression of distaste and irritation.1382i.e., the prophet H´d.1383Upon the earth.  It could also refer to "a tremendous Day," i.e., that of 
resurrection.

50622.They said, "Have you come to delude us away from our gods?  
Then bring us what you promise us, if you should be of the 
truthful."
23.He said, "Knowledge [of its time] is only with AllŒh, and I 
convey to you that with whic h I was sent; but I see you [to be] 
a people behaving ignorantly."
24.And when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys, 
they said, "This is a cloud bringing us rain!"  Rather, it is that 
for which you were impatient:1384  a wind, within it a painful
punishment,
25.Destroying everything by command of its Lord.  And they became
so that nothing was seen [of them] except their dwellings.  
Thus do We recompense the criminal people.
26.And We had certainly established them in such as We have 
not establis hed you, and We made for them hearing and vision 
and hearts [i.e., intellect].  But their hearing and vision and 
hearts availed them not from anything [of the punishment] 
when they were [continually] rejecting the signs of All Œh; and 
they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.
27.And We have already destroyed what surrounds you of [those]
cities, and We have diversified the signs [or verses] that perhaps
they might return [from disbelief].
28.Then why did those they took besides All Œh as deities by which
to approach [Him]1385not aid them?  But they had strayed 
[i.e., departed] from them.  And that was their falsehood and 
what they were inventing.
29.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when We directed to you a few
of the jinn, listening to the QurÕ Œn.  And wh en they attended it, 
they said, "Listen quietly."  And when it was concluded, they 
went back to their people as warners.
                                               
1384When you challenged your prophet .  See verse 22 of this s´rah.1385According to their claim.

50730.They said, "O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] 
Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it 
which guides to the truth and to a straight path.
31.O our people, respond to the Caller [i.e., Messenger] of All Œh1386
and believe in him; He [i.e., AllŒh] will forgive for you your 
sins and protect you from a painful punishment.
32.But he who does not respond to the Caller of AllŒh will not
cause failure [to Him] upon earth, and he will not have besides 
Him any protectors.  Those are in manifest error."
33.Do they not see that All Œh, who created the heavens and earth 
and did not fail in their creation, is able to give li fe to the dead?   
Yes.  Indeed, He is over all things competent.
34.And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it 
will be said], "Is this not the truth?"  They will say, "Yes, by 
our Lord."  He will say, "Then taste the punishment for what 
you used to deny ."1387
35.So be patient, [O Muúammad ], as were those of determination 
among the messengers and do not be impatient for them.1388  It 
will be –on the Day they see that which they are promised –
as though they had not remained [in the world] exce pt an hour 
of a day.  [This is] notification.  And will [any] be destroyed 
except the defiantly disobedient people?
                                               
1386Prophet Muúammad ().1387Or "because you used to disbelieve."1388i.e., for All Œh's punishment of the disbelievers.

1.Those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of All Œh –
He will waste their deeds.1390
2.And those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in 
what has been sent down upon Muúammad –and it is the truth 
from their Lord –He will remove from them their misdeeds and 
amend their condition.
3.That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and 
those who believe follow the truth from their Lord.  Thus does 
AllŒh present to the people their comparisons.1391
4.So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] 
necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then
secure their bonds,1392and either [confer] favor1393afterwards or 
ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens.1394  That [is 
the command].  And if AllŒh had willed, He could have taken 
vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle]
to test some of you by means of others.  And those who are 
killed in the cause of All Œh –never will He waste their deeds.
5.He will guide them and amend their condition
6.And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.
7.O you who have believed, i f you support All Œh, He will support 
you and plant firmly your feet.
8.But those who disbelieve –for them is misery, and He will waste
their deeds.
                                               
1389Muúammad :  (The Prophet) Muúammad ( ).1390i.e., cause them to be lost or make them worthless, earning no reward.1391So that they may know the results of their choice.1392i.e., take those remaining as captives.1393i.e., release them without ransom.1394i.e., its armor, machinery, etc., meaning "until the war is over."

Page 531:
S´rah 47–Muúamma d JuzÕ 26
5099.That is because they disliked what AllŒh revealed, so He 
rendered worthless their deeds.
10.Have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the 
end of those before them?  AllŒh destroyed [everything] over 
them,1395and for the disbelievers is something comparable.
11.That is because AllŒh is the protector of those who have 
believed and because the disbelievers have no protector.
12.Indeed, AllŒh will admit those who have believed and done
righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow, but those
who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as grazing livestock 
eat, and the Fire will be a residence for them.
13.And how many a city was stronger than your city [i.e., Makkah]
which drove you out?  We destroyed them; and there was no 
helper for them.
14.So is he who is on clear evidence from his Lord like him to 
whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they 
follow their [own] desires?
15.Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised,
wherein are rivers of water unaltered,1396rivers of milk the 
taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those 
who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will 
have from all [kinds of] fruits and forgiveness from their 
Lord ...  [Are its inhabitants] like those who abide eternally in 
the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever 
their intestines?
16.And among them, [O Muúammad ], are those who listen to you,
until when they depart from you, they say to those who were 
given knowledge,1397"What has he said just now?"  Those are 
the ones of whom AllŒh has sealed over their hearts and who 
have followed their [own] desires.
                                               
1395i.e., destroyed them and all they owned.1396In taste or smell, neither stagnant nor polluted.1397From among the P rophet's companions.

51017.And those who are guided –He increases them in guidance 
and gives them their righteousness.1398
18.Then do they await except that the Hour should come upon 
them unexpectedly?  But already there have come [some of] 
its indications.  Then how [i.e., what good] to them, when it 
has come, will be their remembrance?
19.So know, [O Muúammad ], that there is no deity except All Œh 
and ask forgiveness for your sin1399and for the believing men 
and believing women.  And AllŒh knows of your movement 
andyour resting place.
20.Those who believe say, "Why has a s´rah1400not been sent 
down?"  But when a precise s´rah is revealed and fighting is 
mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is disease 
[i.e., hypocrisy] looking at you with a look of one ove rcome by
death.  And more appropriate for them1401[would have been]
21.Obedience and good words.  And when the matter [of fighting]
was determined, if they had been true to All Œh, it would have 
been better for them.
22.So would you perhaps, if you turned a way,1402cause corruption
on earth and sever your [ties of] relationship?
23.Those [who do so] are the ones that AllŒh has cursed, so He 
deafened them and blinded their vision.
24.Then do they not reflect upon the QurÕŒn, or are there locks 
upon [their] hea rts?
25.Indeed, those who reverted back [to disbelief] after guidance 
had become clear to them –Satan enticed them and prolonged 
hope for them.
                                               
1398TaqwŒ, meaning piety, consciousness and fear of All Œh, and care to avoid
His displeasure.1399See footnote to 40:55 .1400i.e., one in which permission is given the believers to fight their enemies.1401The words "awlŒ lahum " can also be interp reted as "woe to them!"  In 
that case, the following verse would begin, "[Better for them would 
have been] obedience and good words."1402From Isl Œm or from jihŒd (struggling in the cause of All Œh).

Page 533:
S´rah 47–Muúamma d JuzÕ 26
51126.That is because they said to those who disliked what AllŒh 
sent down,1403"We will obey you in part of the ma tter."  And 
AllŒh knows what they conceal.
27.Then how [will it be] when the angels take them in death, 
striking their faces and their backs?
28.That is because they followed what angered AllŒh and disliked
[what earns] His pleasure, so He rendered worth less their deeds.
29.Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that All Œh would 
never expose their [feelings of] hatred?
30.And if We willed, We could show them to you, and you would 
know them by their mark; but you will surely know them by 
the tone o f [their] speech.  And All Œh knows your deeds.
31.And We will surely test you until We make evident those who 
strive among you [for the cause of All Œh] and the patient, and 
We will test your affairs.
32.Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the 
path of AllŒh and opposed the Messenger after guidance had 
become clear to them –never will they harm All Œh at all, and 
He will render worthless their deeds.
33.O you who have believed, obey All Œh and obey the Messenger 
and do not invalidate you r deeds.
34.Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the 
path of AllŒh and then died while they were disbelievers –
never will All Œh forgive them.
35.So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior; 
and AllŒh is w ith you and will never deprive you of [the 
reward of] your deeds.
36.[This] worldly life is only amusement and diversion.  And if 
you believe and fear All Œh, He will give you your rewards and 
not ask you for your properties.

51237.If He should ask you for them and press y ou, you would withhold, 
and He would expose your hatred [i.e., unwillingness].
38.Here you are –those invited to spend in the cause of AllŒh –
but among you are those who withhold [out of greed].  And 
whoever withholds only withholds [benefit] from himse lf; and 
AllŒh is the Free of need, while you are the needy.  And if you 
turn away [i.e., refuse], He will replace you with another people;
then they will not be the likes of you.

and guide you to a straight path
3.And [that] All Œh may aid you with a mighty victory.
4.It is He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers

1404Al-Fatú :  The Conquest.1405Ibn MasÔ´d said, "You [people] consider the conquest to be that of Makkah, 
but we consider it to be the Treaty of al-îudaybiyyah."  Al-BukhŒr¥
reported a similar quotation from al -BarŒÕ bin Ôzib.  Although initially 
regarded by the companions as a setback, the treaty, in effect, served to 
promote the spread of Isl Œm, which led to the conquest of Makkah two 
years later.

5149.That you [people] may believe in AllŒh and His Messenger 
and honor him and respect him [i.e., the Prophet ()] and 
exalt Him [i.e., All Œh] morning and afternoon.
10.Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muúammad ] –
they are actually pledging allegiance to All Œh.  The hand1406of 
AllŒh is over their hands.1407  So he who breaks his word only 
breaks it to the detriment of himself.  And he who fulfills that 
which he has promised All Œh –He will give him a great reward.
11.Those who remained behind of the bedouins will say to you, 
"Our properties and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness
for us."  They say with their tongues what is not within their
hearts.  Say, "Then who could prevent AllŒh at all if He intended
for you harm or intended for you benefit?  Rather, ever is All Œh,
with what you do, Acquainted.
12.But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would
never return to their families, ever, and that was made pleasing 
in your hearts.  And you assumed an assumption of evil and 
became a people ruined."
13.And whoever has not believed in AllŒh and His Messenger –
then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze.
14.And to All Œh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.  
He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.  And
ever is All Œh Forgiving and Merciful.
15.Those who remained behind will say when you set out tow ard 
the war booty to take it, "Let us follow you."  They wish to 
change the words of AllŒh.  Say, "Never will you follow us.  
Thus did All Œh say before."  So they will say, "Rather, you envy
us."  But [in fact] they were not understanding except a little .1408
16.Say to those who remained behind of the bedouins, "You will 
be called to [face] a people of great military might; you may 
                                               
1406See footnote to 2:19.1407Meaning that He ( subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) accepted their pledge.1408i.e., they only understood the material aspects of life.

515fight them, or they will submit.1409  So if you obey, All Œh will 
give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turned 
away bef ore, He will punish you with a painful punishment."
17.There is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt
or upon the ill any guilt [for remaining behind].  And whoever 
obeys All Œh and His Messenger –He will admit him to gardens
beneath whi ch rivers flow; but whoever turns away –He will 
punish him with a painful punishment.
18.Certainly was AllŒh pleased with the believers when they
pledged allegiance to you, [O Muúammad ], under the tree, and 
He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent do wn tranquility 
upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest1410
19.And much war booty which they will take.  And ever is All Œh 
Exalted in Might and Wise.
20.AllŒh has promised you much booty that you will take [in the 
future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld 
the hands of people from you –that it may be a sign for the 
believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path.
21.And [He promises] other [victories] that you were [so far] 
unable to [realize] which AllŒh has already encompassed.1411  
And ever is All Œh, over all things, competent.
22.And if those [Makkans] who disbelieve had fought you, they 
would have turned their backs [in flight].  Then they would 
not find a protector or a helper.
23.[This is] the established way ofAllŒh which has occurred before.  
And never will you find in the way of All Œh any change.
24.And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands 
from them within [the area of] Makkah after He caused you to 
overcome them.  And ever is All Œh, of what you do, Seeing.
                                               
1409To All Œh in Isl Œm.1410That of Khaybar, which preceded the conquest of Makkah.1411i.e., prepared for you or decreed.

51625.They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from 
al-Masjid al -îarŒm while the offering1412was prevented from 
reaching its place of sacrifice.  And if not for believing men 
and believing women whom you did not know –that you might
trample [i.e., kill] them and there would befall you because of 
them dishonor without [your] knowledge –[you would have 
been permitted to enter Makkah].  [This was so] that AllŒh 
might admit to His mercy whom He willed.  If they had been 
apart [from them], We would have punished those who 
disbelieved among them with painful punishment
26.When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts 
chauvinism –the chauvinism of the time of ignorance.  But 
AllŒh sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon 
the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness, 
and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it.  And ever 
is All Œh, of all things, Knowing.
27.Certainly has All Œh showed to His Messenger the vision [i.e., 
dream] in truth.  Youwill surely enter al-Masjid al-îarŒm, if 
AllŒh wills, in safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] 
shortened ,1413not fearing [anyone].  He knew what you did not 
know and has arranged before that a conquest near [at hand].
28.It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion
of truth to manifest it over all religion.  And sufficient is All Œh 
as Witness.
29.Muúammad is the Messenger of All Œh; and those with him are 
forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves.  
You see them bowin g and prostrating [in prayer], seeking 
bounty from All Œh and [His] pleasure.  Their mark [i.e., sign] 
is on their faces [i.e., foreheads] from the trace of prostration.  
That is their description in the Torah.  And their description in 
the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and
strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks,
                                               
1412i.e., seventy camels int ended for sacrifice and feeding of the poor.1413i.e., having completed the rites of Ôumrah.

517delighting the sowers –so that He [i.e., All Œh] may enrage by 
them1414the disbelievers.  All Œh has promised those who believe
and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great 
reward.

1.O you who have believed, do not put [yourselves] before All Œh 
and His Messenger1416but fear All Œh.  Indeed, All Œh is Hearing 
and Knowing.
2.O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the
voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness 
of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while 
you perceive not.
3.Indeed, those who lower their voices before the Messenger of 
AllŒh –they are the ones whose hearts AllŒh has tested for 
righteousness.  For them is forgiveness and great reward.
4.Indeed, those who call you, [O Muúammad ], from behind the 
chambers –most of them do not use reason.
5.And if they had been patient until you [cou ld] come out to them,
it would have been better for them.  But All Œh is Forgiving and 
Merciful.
6.O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient 
one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of 
ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.
7.And know that among you is the Messenger of All Œh.  If he were 
to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, 
butAllŒh has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing 
in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance 
and disobedience.  Those are the [rightly] guided.
8.[It is] as bounty from AllŒh and favor.  And AllŒh is Knowing 
and Wise.

5199.And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make
settlement between the two.  But i f one of them oppresses the 
other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to
the ordinance of All Œh.  And if it returns, then make settlement
between them in justice and act justly.  Indeed, AllŒh loves 
those who act justly.
10.The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between 
your brothers.  And fear All Œh that you may receive mercy.
11.O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] 
people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women 
ridicule [other] wom en; perhaps they may be better than them.  
And do not insult one another and do not call each other by 
[offensive] nicknames.  Wretched is the name [i.e., mention] of
disobedience after [one's] faith.  And whoever does not repent –
then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
12.O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption.  
Indeed, some assumption is sin.  And do not spy or backbite 
each other.  Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother
when dead?  You would detest it.  And fear AllŒh; indeed, 
AllŒh is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.
13.O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female 
and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one 
another.  Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of All Œh is 
the most righteou s1417of you.  Indeed, AllŒh is Knowing and 
Acquainted.
14.The bedouins say, "We have believed."  Say, "You have not 
[yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted,' for faith 
has not yet entered your hearts.  And if you obey AllŒh and 
His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds1418
of anything.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful."
                                               
1417Literally, "he who has the most taqwŒ, " i.e., consciousness and fear of 
AllŒh, piety and righteousness.1418i.e., the reward thereof.

52015.The believers are only the ones who have believed in AllŒh 
and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their 
properties and their lives in the cau se of All Œh.  It is those who 
are the truthful.
16.Say, "Would you acquaint All Œh with your religion while All Œh
knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,
and All Œh is Knowing of all things?"
17.They consider it a favor to you that t hey have accepted Isl Œm.  
Say, "Do not consider your Isl Œm a favor to me.  Rather, All Œh 
has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the 
faith, if you should be truthful."
18.Indeed, AllŒh knows the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and 
the earth .  And All Œh is Seeing of what you do.

3.Whe n we have died and have become dust, [we will return to

4.We know what the earth diminishes [i.e., consumes] of them,

20.And the Horn will be blown.  That is the Day of [carrying out]

21.And every soul will come, with it a driver and a witness.1426
22.[It will be said], "You were certainly in unmindfulness of this, 
and We have removed from you your cover,1427so your sight, 
this Day, is sharp."
23.And his companion, [the angel], will say, "This [record ] is 
what is with me, prepared."
24.[AllŒh will say], "Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever,
25.Preventer of good, aggressor, and doubter,
26.Who made [as equal] with All Œh another deity; then throw him

transgress, but he [himself] was in extreme error."

presented to you the threat [i.e., warning].
29.The word [i.e., decree] will not b e changed with Me, and never
will I be unjust to the servants."
30.On the Day We will say to Hell, "Have you been filled?" and 
it will say, "Are there some more ,"
31.And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far,
32.[It will be said], "This is what you were promised –for every

33.Who feared the Most Merciful unseen and came with a heart 
returning [in repentance].
34.Enter it in peace.  This is the Day of Eternity."

1503i.e., shirk (association with All Œh) or disbelief.1504i.e., semen, which contains the potential for human life.1505An alternative meaning has also been given:  "...in that We will replace

mentione d because of the special convenience to them, although it is a 
provision for all people in general.1509AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) confirms absolutely by oath.1510The Preserved Slate (al-Lawú al-Maúf´ th), which is with AllŒh (subúŒnahu

54981.Then is it to this statement that you are indifferent
82.And make [the thanks for] your provision that you deny [the 
Provider]?

86.Then why do you not, if you are not to be recompensed,

88.And if he [i.e., the deceased] was of those brought near [to

91.Then [the angels will say], "Peace for you; [you are] from the 
companions of the right."

when it is decreed, you will not escape the recompense when it is decreed.

1.Whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts All Œh,1513and He is 
the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
2.His is the dominion of t he heavens and earth.  He gives life and 
causes death, and He is over all things competent.
3.He is the First and the Last, the Ascendan t1514and the Intimate ,1515
and He is, of all things, Knowing.
4.It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then 
established Himself above the Throne.1516  He knows what 
penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what 
descends from the heaven and what ascends therein; and He is 
with you1517wherever you are.  And AllŒh, of what you do, is 
Seeing.
5.His is the dominion of the heavens and earth.  And to All Œh are 
returned [all] matters.
6.He causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter 
the night, and He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
7.Believe in AllŒh and His Messenger and spend out of that in 
which He has made you successive inheritors .  For those who 
have believed among you and spent,1518there will be a great 
reward.
                                               
1512Al-îadeed :  Iron.1513By praising Him and declaring Him far above and beyond any failure or 
imperfection.1514Nothin g being above Him.  Another meaning is "the Apparent," i.e., 
evident through His creation and revelation.1515Nothing being nearer than Him by way of His knowledge.  Another
meaning is "the Unapparent," i.e., concealed from man's physical senses.1516See footnot e to 2:19.1517In knowledge –observing and witnessing.1518In ways pleasing to All Œh.

S´rah 57–al-îadeed JuzÕ 27
5518.And why do you not believe in AllŒh while the Messenger 
invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your 
covenant, if you should [truly] be believers?
9.It is He who sends down upon His Servant [ Muúammad ()] 
verses of clear evidence that He may bring you out from 
darknesses into the light.  And indeed, AllŒh is to you Kind 
and Merciful.
10.And why do you not spend in the cause of AllŒh while to 
AllŒh belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth?  Not 
equal among you are those who spent before the conquest [of 
Makkah] and fought [and those who did so after it].  Those are 
greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought.  
But to all AllŒh has promised the best [reward].  And AllŒh, 
with what you do, is Acquainted.
11.Who is it that would loan AllŒh a goodly loan so He will 
multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward?
12.On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, 
their light proceeding before them and on their right, [it will 
be said], "Your good tidings today are [of] gardens beneath 
which rivers flow, wherein you will abide eternally."  That is 
what is the great att ainment.
13.On the [same] Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women 
will say to those who believed, "Wait for us that we may 
acquire some of your light."  It will be said, "Go back behind 
you1519and seek light."  And a wall will be placed between 
them with a door, its interior containing mercy, but on the 
outside of it is torment.
14.They [i.e., the hypocrites] will call to them [i.e., the believers], 
"Were we not with you?"  They will say, "Yes, but you afflicted
yourselves1520and awaited [misfortune for us]and doubted, 
and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command
of All Œh.  And the Deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning
AllŒh.
                                               
1519To where light was acquired, i.e., in the worldly life.1520By hypocrisy or by falling into temptations.

55215.So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who 
disbelieved.  Your refuge is the Fire.  It is most worthy of you, 
and wretched is the destination."
16.Has the time not come for those who have believed that their 
hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance 
of All Œh and what has come down of the truth?  And let them 
not be like those who were given the Scripture before, anda 
long period passed over them, so their hearts hardened; and 
many of them are defiantly disobedient.
17.Know that All Œh gives life to the earth after its lifelessness.  We 
have made clear to you the signs; perha ps you will understand .1521
18.Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who 
practice charity and [they who] have loaned AllŒh a goodly 
loan –it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a 
noble reward.
19.And those who have believed in AllŒh and His messengers –
those are [in the ranks of] the supporters of truth and the 
martyrs, with their Lord.  For them is their reward and their 
light.1522  But those who have disbelieved and denied Our 
verses –those are the companions of Hellfire.
20.Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion
and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in 
increase of wealth and children –like the example of a rain 
whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the tillers; then it dries 
and you s ee it turned yellow; then it becomes [scattered] debris.   
And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness 
from All Œh and approval.  And what is the worldly life except 
the enjoyment of delusion.
                                               
1521That similarly, AllŒh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ) can soften a heart after its 
hardness and guide one who had previously been astray.1522Another accepted meaning is "And those who have believed in AllŒh 
and His messengers –they are the supporters of truth.  And the martyrs, 
with their Lord, will have their reward and their light."

S´rah 57–al-îadeed JuzÕ 27
55321.Race [i.e., compete] toward forgiveness from yo ur Lord and a 
Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth,
prepared for those who believed in All Œh and His messengers.  
That is the bounty of All Œh which He gives to whom He wills, 
and All Œh is the possessor of great bounty.
22.No disas ter strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except 
that it is in a register1523before We bring it into being –indeed 
that, for All Œh, is easy –
23.In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not 
exult [in pride] over what He has given you .  And All Œh does 
not like everyone self -deluded and boastful –
24.[Those] who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess.  
And whoever turns away1524–then indeed, AllŒh is the Free 
of need, the Praiseworthy.
25.We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences 
and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that 
the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice.  And We 
sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits 
for the people, and so that All Œh may make evident those who
support Him and His messengers unseen.  Indeed, AllŒh is 
Powerful and Exalted in Might.
26.And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in 
their descendants prophethood and scripture; and among them 
is he who is guided, but many of them are defia ntly disobedient.
27.Then We sent following their footsteps [i.e., traditions] Our 
messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, 
and gave him the Gospel.  And We placed in the hearts of those
who followed him compassion and mercy and monasti cism, 
which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except 
[that they did so] seeking the approval of All Œh.  But they did 
not observe it with due observance.  So We gave the ones who 
                                               
1523i.e., the Preserved Slate ( al-Lawú al -Maúf´ th).1524Refusing to spend for All Œh's cause or refusing obedience to Him.

554believed among them their reward, but many of them are 
defiantl y disobedient.
28.O you who have believed, fear AllŒh and believe in His 
Messenger; He will [then] give you a double portion of His 
mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and 
forgive you; and All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
29.[This is] s o that the People of the Scripture may know that they 
are not able [to obtain] anything from the bounty of AllŒh1525
and that [all] bounty is in the hand1526of All Œh; He gives it to 
whom He wills.  And All Œh is the possessor of great bounty.
                                               
1525As long as they refuse to believe in the message of AllŒh which was 
conveyed through Muúammad ( ).1526See footnote to 2:19.

1.Certainly has All Œh heard the speech of the one who argues [i.e., 
pleads] with you, [O Muúammad ], concerning her husband and 
directs her complaint to All Œh.  And All Œh hears your dialogue; 
indeed, All Œh is Hearing and Seein g.
2.Those who pronounce thihŒr1528among you [to separate] from 
their wives –they are not [consequently] their mothers.  Their 
mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.  And indeed,
they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood.  But 
indeed, All Œh is Pardoning and Forgiving.
3.And those who pronounce thihŒr from their wives and then 
[wish to] go back on what they said –then [there must be] the 
freeing of a slave before they touch one another.  That is what 
you are admonished thereby; and All Œh is Acquainted with what 
you do.
4.And he who does not find [a slave] –then a fast for two months 
consecutively1529before they touch one another; and he who is 
unable –then the feeding of sixty poor persons.  That is for you 
to believe [complete ly] in AllŒh and His Messenger; and those 
are the limits [set by] AllŒh.  And for the disbelievers is a 
painful punishment.
5.Indeed, those who oppose All Œh and His Messenger are abased 
as those before them were abased.  And We have certainly sent 
down verses of clear evidence.  And for the disbelievers is a 
humiliating punishment
6.On the Day when All Œh will resurrect them all and inform them 
                                               
1527Al-MujŒdilah :  Th e Arguing (or Pleading) Woman.1528The saying by a husband to his wife, "You are to me like the back of my 
mother," meaning unlawful to approach.  This was a type of divorce 
practiced by the Arabs before the prophethood of Muúammad ( ).1529See footnote to 4:92.

S´rah 58–al-MujŒdilah JuzÕ 28
556of what they did.  AllŒh had enumerated it, while they forgot 
it; and All Œh is, over all things, Witness.
7.Have you not considered that All Œh knows what is in the heavens
and what is on the earth?  There is in no private conversation 
three but that He is the fourth of them,1530nor are there five 
but that He is the sixth of them –and no less than that and no 
more except that He is with them [in knowledge] wherever 
they are.  Then He will inform them of what they did, on the 
Day of Resurrection.  Indeed All Œh is, of all things, Knowing.
8.Have you not considered those who were forbidden from 
private conversation [i.e., ridicule and conspiracy] and then 
return to that which they were forbidden and converse among 
themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the 
Messenger?  And when they come to you, they greet you with 
that [word] by which AllŒh does notgreet you1531and say 
among themselves, "Why does AllŒh not punish us for what 
we say?"  Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will [enter to]
burn, and wretched is the destination.
9.O you who have believed, when you converse privately, do 
not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the 
Messenger but converse about righteousness and piety.  And 
fear All Œh, to whom you will be gathered.
10.Private conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve 
those who have believed,1532but he will not harm them at all 
except by permission of All Œh.  And upon All Œh let the believers
rely.
                                               
1530Through His knowledge of them and their secrets.1531This is in reference to the Jews who would greet the Muslims with the 
words "Death be upon you," rather than "Peace."1532The reference may be to the sinful type of conversation, as mentioned in 
the previous verses, or to the practice of two persons speaking in 
confidence in the presence of a third, which might lead him to assume 
that he is the subject of their conversation.  Such behavior was 
prohibited by the Prophet ( ) in narrations of al -BukhŒr¥ and Muslim.

S´rah 58–al-MujŒdilah JuzÕ 28
55711.O you who have believed, when you are told, "Space yourselves"
in assemblies, then make space; AllŒh will make space for 
you.1533  And when you are told, "Arise,"1534then arise; All Œh 
will raise those who have believed among you and those who 
were given knowledge, by degrees.  And All Œh is Acquainted 
with what you do.
12.O you who have believed, when you [wish to] privately consult
the Messenger, present before your consu ltation a charity.  That
is better for you and purer.  But if you find not [the means] –
then indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
13.Have you feared to present before your consultation charities?  
Then when you do not and AllŒh has forgiven you, then [at 
least] establish prayer and give zakŒh and obey All Œh and His 
Messenger.  And All Œh is Acquainted with what you do.
14.Have you not considered those who make allies of a people 
with whom All Œh has become angry?  They are neither of you 
nor of them, a nd they swear to untruth while they know [they 
are lying].
15.AllŒh has prepared for them a severe punishment.  Indeed, it 
was evil that they were doing.
16.They took their [false] oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] 
from the way of All Œh, and for them is a humiliating punishment.
17.Never will their wealth or their children avail them against 
AllŒh at all.  Those are the companions of the Fire; they will 
abide therein eternally
18.On the Day All Œh will resurrect them all, and they will swear 
to Him as they swear to you and think that they are [standing] 
on something.1535  Unquestionably, it is they who are the liars.
19.Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance
                                               
1533In His mercy, in Paradise, or in everything good.1534To prayer, to battle, or to good deeds.1535They assume that their lies will be believed and that they will escape 
detection as they did in worldly life.

558of AllŒh.  Those are the party of Satan.  Unquestionably, the 
party o f Satan –they will be the losers.
20.Indeed, the ones who oppose All Œh and His Messenger –those 
will be among the most humbled.
21.AllŒh has written [i.e., decreed], "I will surely overcome, I and
My messengers."  Indeed, All Œh is Powerful and Exalted in Might.
22.You will not find a people who believe in All Œh and the Last Day
having affection for those who oppose AllŒh and His Messenger,
even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or 
their kindred.  Those –He has decreed within t heir hearts faith 
and supported them with spirit1536from Him.  And We will
admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they
abide eternally.  AllŒh is pleased with them, and they are pleased
with Him –those are the party of All Œh.  Unquestionab ly, the 
party of All Œh –they are the successful.

2.It is He who expelled the ones who disbeli eved among the People
of the Scripture1539from their homes at the first gathering.1540  
You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their 
fortresses would protect them from AllŒh; but [the decree of] 
AllŒh came upon them from where they had not expected, and 
He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses 
by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers.  So take 
warning, O people of vision.
3.And if not that All Œh had decreed for them evacuation, He would
have punished them i n [this] world, and for them in the Hereafter
is the punishment of the Fire.

whoever opposes All Œh –then indeed, All Œh is severe in penalty.
5.Whatever you have cut down of [their] palm trees or left standing
on their trunks –it was by permission of All Œh and so He would 
disgrace the defiantly disobedient.
6.And what AllŒh restored [of property] to His Messenger from 
them –you did not spur for it [in an expedition] any horses or 
camels,1541butAllŒh gives His messengers power over whom 
He wills, and All Œh is over all things competent.
7.And what AllŒh restored to His Messenger from the people of

so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich 
from among you.  And whatever the Messenger has given you –
take; and what he has forbidden you –refrain from.  And fear 
AllŒh; indeed, All Œh is severe in penalty.
8.For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and 
their properties, seeking bounty from All Œh and [His] approval
and supporting All Œh and His Messenger, [there is also a share].  
Those are the truthful.
9.And [also for] those who were settled in the Home [i.e., 
al-Mad¥nah] and [adopted] the faith before them.1544  They 
love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in 
their breasts of what they [i.e., the emigrants] were given but 
give [them] preference over themselves, even though t hey are 
in privation.  And whoever is protected from the stinginess of 
his soul –it is those who will be the successful.
10.And [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, 
"Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith
and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who 
have believed.  Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful."
11.Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying 
to their brothers [i.e., associates] who have disbelieved among 
the People of the Scripture, "If you are expelled, we will surely
leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone –
ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you."  But All Œh 
testifies that they are liars.
12.If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they

spoils of war in which four fifths is distributed among those who fought 
in All Œh's cause.1544Before the settlement of the emigrants (MuhŒjireen) among the An§Œr,

aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] 
they will not be aided.
13.You [believers] are more fearful within their breasts than All Œh.  
That is because they are a people who do not understand.
14.They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from
behind walls.  Their violence [i.e., enmity] among themselves 
is severe.  You think they are together, but their hearts are 
diverse. That is because they are a people who do not reason.
15.[Theirs is] like the example of those shortly before them:  they 
tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a 
painful punishment.
16.[The hypocrites are] like the example of Satan when he says 
to man, "Disbelieve."  But when he disbelieves, he says, 
"Indeed, I am disassociated from you.  Indeed, I fear AllŒh, 
Lord of the worlds."
17.So the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire,
abiding eternally therein.  Andthat is the recompense of the 
wrongdoers.
18.O you who have believed, fear All Œh.  And let every soul look 
to what it has put forth for tomorrow –and fear AllŒh.  
Indeed, All Œh is Acquainted with what you do.
19.And be not like those who forgot AllŒh, so He made them 
forget themselves.  Those are the defiantly disobedient.
20.Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions 
of Paradise.  The companions of Paradise –they are the attainers
[of success].
21.If We had sent down this QurÕ Œn upo n a mountain, you would 
have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of AllŒh.  And 
these examples We present to the people that perhaps they 
will give thought.

1.O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your 
enemies as allies,1550extending to them affection while they 
have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth, having driven 
out the Prophet and yourselves [only] because you believe in 
AllŒh, your Lord.  If you have come out for jihŒd [i.e., fighting 
or striving] in My cause and seeking means to My approval, 
[take them not as friends].  You confide to them affection [i.e., 
instruction], but I am most knowing of what you have 
concealed and what you have declared.  And whoever does it 
among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.
2.If they gain dominance over you, they would be [i.e., behave] to 
you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their 
tongues w ith evil, and they wish you would disbelieve.
3.Never will your relatives or your children benefit you; the Day 
of Resurrection He will judge between you.  And All Œh, of what 
you do, is Seeing.
4.There has already been for you an excellent pattern1551in 
Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, 
"Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you 
worship other than AllŒh.  We have denied you, and there has 
appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until 
you believe i n All Œh alone" –except for the saying of Abraham 
to his father, "I will surely ask forgiveness for you, but I have 
not [power to do] for you anything against AllŒh.  Our Lord, 
upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned, and to 
You is the destina tion.

6.There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern 
for anyone whose hope is in AllŒh and the Last Day.  And 
whoever turns away –then indeed, AllŒh is the Free of need, 
the Praiseworthy.
7.Perhaps All Œh will put, between you and those to whom you have 
been enemies among them, affection.  And All Œh is competent ,1552
and All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
8.AllŒh does not forbid you from those who do not fight you 
because of religion and do not expel you from your homes –
from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward 
them.  Indeed, All Œh loves those who act justly.
9.AllŒh only forbids you from those who fight you because of 
religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your 
expulsion –[forbids] that you make allies1553of them.  And 
whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the 
wrongdoers.
10.O you who have bel ieved, when the believing women come to 
you as emigrants, examine [i.e., test] them.  AllŒh is most 
knowing as to their faith.  And if you know them to be 
believers, then do not return them to the disbelievers; they are 
not lawful [wives] for them, nor arethey lawful [husbands] 
for them.  But give them [i.e., the disbelievers] what they have 
spent.1554  And there is no blame upon you if you marry them 
when you have given them their due compensation [i.e., mahr].   
And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelievi ng women, but 
ask for what you have spent and let them [i.e., the disbelievers]
ask for what they have spent.1555  That is the judgement of

11.And if you have lost any of your wives to the disbeli evers and 
you subsequently obtain [something],1556then give those 
whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent.  
And fear All Œh, in whom you are believers.
12.O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging 
to you that they will not associate anything with All Œh, nor will 
they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse,
nor will they kill their children, nor will they bring forth a 
slander they have invented between their arms and legs,1557
nor will they disobey you in what is right –then accept their 
pledge and ask forgiveness for them of AllŒh.  Indeed, AllŒh 
is Forgiving and Merciful.
13.O you who have believed, do not make allies of a people with 
whom AllŒh has become angry.  They have despaired of 
[reward in] the Herea fter just as the disbelievers have despaired
of [meeting] the companions [i.e., inhabitants] of the graves.
                                                                      
husband could demand in return the equivalent of her mahr.   Likewise, 
the disbelievers had a similar right when a believing woman joined the 
Muslims.  This andthe following verses were revealed subsequent to 
the Treaty of al -îudaybiyyah.1556From the side of the disbelievers, i.e., war booty or a believing woman 
seeking refuge with the Muslims.1557This is an allusion to pregnancy and childbirth, i.e., to falsely att ribute a 
child (whether adopted or born of adultery) to a woman's husband.

4.Indeed, AllŒh loves those who fight in His cause in a row as 
though they are a [single] structure joined firmly.
5.And [mention, O Muúammad ], when Moses said to his people, 
"O my people, why do you harm me while you certainly know 
that I am the messenger of AllŒh to you?"  And when they 
deviated, AllŒh caused their hearts to deviate.  And AllŒh does
not gui de the defiantly disobedient people.
6.And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, "O Children 
of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of All Œh to you confirming 
what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of 
a messenger to come after me, whose name is Aúmad."1560  But 
when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, "This is 
obvious magic."1561
7.And who is more unjust than one who invents about All Œh untruth

8.They want to extinguish the light of All Œh with their mouths, but
AllŒh will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.

13.And [you will obtain] another [favor] that you love –victory 
from AllŒh and an imminent conquest; and give good tidings

Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, "Who are my 
supporters for All Œh?"  The disciples said, "We are supporters 
of All Œh."  And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and
a faction disbelieved.  So We supported those who believed

2.They have taken their oaths as a cover, so they averted [people] 
from the way of All Œh.  Inde ed, it was evil that they were doing.
3.That is because they believed, and then they disbelieved; so 
their hearts were sealed over, and they do not understand.
4.And when you see them, their forms please you, and if they

AllŒh destroy them; how are they deluded?
5.And when it is said to them, "Come, the Messenger of AllŒh 
will ask forgiveness for you," they turn their heads aside and 
you see them evading while they are arrogant.

Indeed, All Œh does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.

5.Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved

they will have a painful punishment.
6.That is bec ause their messengers used to come to them with

and disbelieved and turned away.  And AllŒh dispensed [with

them out of their [husbands'] houses, nor should they [themselves]
leave [during that period] unless they are committing a clear

And if they should be pregnant, then spend on them until they

payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way; 
but if you are in discord, then there may breastfeed for him 
[i.e., the father] another woman.1578
7.Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth, and he whose 
provision is restricted –let him spend from what AllŒh has 
given him.  All Œh does not charge a soul except [acco rding to] 
what He has given it.  AllŒh will bring about, after hardship, 
ease [i.e., relief].
8.And how many a city was insolent toward the command of its 
Lord and His messengers, so We took it to severe account and 
punished it with a terrible punishment .
9.And it tasted the bad consequence of its affair [i.e., rebellion], 
and the outcome of its affair was loss.
10.AllŒh has prepared for them a severe punishment; so fear All Œh,
O you of understanding who have believed.  AllŒh has sent 
down to you a mes sage [i.e., the QurÕ Œn].1579
11.[He sent] a Messenger [i.e., Muúammad ()] reciting to you

And whoever believes in AllŒh and does righteousness –He 
will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide
therein forever.  All Œh will have perfected for him a provision.
12.It is All Œh who has created seven heavens and of the earth, the 
like of them.1580  [His] command descends among them so you 
may know that AllŒh is over all things competent and that 
AllŒh has encompassed all things in knowledge.

1.O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yourself from] what All Œh has 
made lawful for you, seeking the approval of your wives?  And 
AllŒh is Forgiving and Merciful.
2.AllŒh has already ordained for you [Muslims] the dissolution of 
your oaths.1582  And AllŒh is your protector, and He is the 
Knowing, the Wise.
3.And [remember] when the Prophet confided to one of his wives 
a statement; and when she informed [another] of it and AllŒh 
showed it to him, he made known part of it and ignored a part.  
And when he informed her about it, she said, "Who told you this?"   
He said, "I was informed by the Knowing, the Acquainted."
4.If you two [wives] repent to AllŒh, [it is best], for your hearts 
have deviated.  But if you cooperate against him –then indeed 
AllŒh is his protector, and Gabriel and the righteous of the 
believers and the angels, moreover, are [his] assistants.
5.Perhaps his Lord, if he divorced you [all], would substit ute for 
him wives better than you –submitting [to AllŒh], believing, 
devoutly obedient, repentant, worshipping, and traveling1583–
[ones] previously married and virgins.
6.O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families 
from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are 
[appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey All Œh 
in what He commands them but do what they are commanded.
7.O you who have disbelieved, make no excuses that Day.  You 
will only be recompensed for what y ou used to do.

5788.O you who have believed, repent to All Œh with sincere repentance.   
Perhaps1584your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds 
and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow [on] the 
Day when AllŒh will not disgrace the Prophet and those who 
believed with him.  Their light will proceed before them and 
on their right; they will say, "Our Lord, perfect for us our light 
and forgive us.  Indeed, You are over all things competent."
9.O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocri tes 
and be harsh upon them.  And their refuge is Hell, and wretched
is the destination.
10.AllŒh presents an example of those who disbelieved:  the wife 
of Noah and the wife of Lot.  They were under two of Our 
righteous servants but betrayed them,1585so they [i.e., those 
prophets] did not avail them from All Œh at all, and it was said, 
"Enter the Fire with those who enter."
11.And AllŒh presents an example of those who believed:  the 
wife of Pharaoh, when she said, "My Lord, build for me near 
You a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his 
deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people."
12.And [the example of] Mary, the daughter of ÔImrŒn,who 
guarded her chastity, so We blew into [her garment] through 
Our angel [i.e., Gabriel], and she believed in t he words of her 
Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient.

3.[And] who created seven heavens in layers.1587  You do not 
see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency.  So 
return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any br eaks?
4.Then return [your] vision twice again.1588  [Your] vision will 
return to you humbled while it is fatigued.
5.And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with 
lamps [i.e., stars] and have made [from] them what is thrown

6.And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment 
of Hell, and wretched is the destination.
7.When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful]

8.It almost bursts with rage.  Every time a company is thrown into 
it, its keepers ask them, "Did there not come to you a warner?"
9.They will say, "Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied 
and said, 'All Œh has not sent down anything.  You are not but 
in great error. '"
10.And they will say, "If only we had been listening or reasoning,
we would not be among the companions of the Blaze."

16.Do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the heaven 
would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would
sway?1593
17.Or do you feel secure that He who [holds authority] in the 
heaven would not send against you a storm of stones?  Then

18.And already had those before them denied, and how [terrible] 
was My reproach.
19.Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread 
and [sometimes] folded in?  None holds them [aloft] except 
the Most Merciful.  Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing.
20.Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than
the Most Merciful?  The disbeliev ers are not but in delusion.
21.Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His 
provision?  But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.
22.Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one 
who walks erect on a straight path?
23.Say, "It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing
and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful."

59017.It invites he who turned his back [on truth] and went away 
[from obedience]
18.And collected [wealth] and hoarded.
19.Indeed, mankind was created anxious:
20.When evil touches him, impa tient,
21.And when good touches him, withholding [of it],
22.Except the observers of prayer –
23.Those who are constant in their prayer
24.And those within whose wealth is a known right1626
25.For the petitioner and the deprived –
26.And those who belie ve in the Day of Recompense
27.And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord –
28.Indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not that from which 
one is safe –
29.And those who guard their private parts
30.Except from their wives or those their right hands possess,1627
for indeed, they are not to be blamed –
31.But whoever seeks beyond that, then they are the transgressors –
32.And those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
33.And those who are in their testimonies upright
34.And thos e who [carefully] maintain their prayer:
35.They will be in gardens,1628honored.
36.So what is [the matter] with those who disbelieve, hastening 
[from] before you, [O Muúammad ],
37.[To sit] on [your] right and [your] left in separate groups?1629

59138.Does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of 
pleasure?
39.No!  Indeed, We have created them from that which they 
know.1630
40.So I swear by the Lord of [all] risings and settings1631that 
indeed We are able
41.To replace them with better than them; and Weare not to be 
outdone.
42.So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until 
they meet their Day which they are promised –
43.The Day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they 
were, toward an erected idol, hastening.1632
44.Their eyes h umbled, humiliation will cover them.  That is the 
Day which they had been promised.
                                               
1630i.e., a liquid disdained.  So how can they expect to enter Paradise except 
by the will of their Creator?1631i.e., All Œh (subúŒnahu wa taÔŒlŒ ), who determines the point at which the 
sun, moon and stars rise and set according to season and every position 
of observation.1632i.e., just as they used to race, whenever an idol was newly appointed, to 
be the first of its worshippers.

4.He [i.e., All Œh] will forgive you of your sins and delay you for 
a specified term.  Indeed, the time [set by] All Œh, when it comes,
will not be delayed, if you only knew. '"
5.He said, "My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night 
and day.
6.But my invitation increased them not except in flight [i.e., 
aversion].
7.And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive 
them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves 
with their garments,1634persisted, and were arrogant with 
[great] arrogance.
8.Then I invited them publicly.
9.Then I announc ed to them and [also] confided to them secretly

17.And AllŒh has caused you to grow from the earth a 
[progressive] growth.
18.Then He will return you into it and extract you [another]

19.And All Œh has made for you the earth an expanse
20.That you may follow therein roads of passage. '"
21.Noah said, "My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and 
followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him

SuwŒÔ or Yagh´th and YaÔ´ q and Nasr.'1637
24.And already they have misled many.  And, [my Lord], do not 
increase the wrongdoers except in error."

among the disbelievers an inhabitant.
27.Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and

28.My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my 
house a believer and the believing men and believing women.

1.Say, [O Muúammad ], "It has been revealed to me that a grou p 
of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing
QurÕŒn [i.e., recitation].
2.It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it.  And 
we will never associate with our Lord anyone.
3.And [it teaches] that exalted is the noblene ss of our Lord; He 
has not taken a wife or a son
4.And that our foolish one [i.e., Iblees]1639has been saying 
about All Œh an excessive transgression.
5.And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never 
speak about All Œh a lie.
6.And there were m en from mankind who sought refuge in men 
from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden [i.e., sin].
7.And they had thought, as you thought, that All Œh would never 
send anyone [as a messenger].
8.And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled 
with powerful guards and burning flames.
9.And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing,1640but 
whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait 
for him.
10.And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for 
those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right 
course.
                                               
1638Al-Jinn:  The Jinn, a species of beings created by All Œh from fire.1639A plural form may also be understood, i.e., "the foolish ones among us."1640Before the prophethood of Muúammad () the jinn used to collect 
information by eavesdropping on the angels and then pass it on to 
fortunetellers and soothsayers.

not so; we were [of] divided ways.1641
12.And we have become certain that we will never cause failure 
to All Œh upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.
13.And when we heard the guidance [i.e., the QurÕ Œn], we believed
in it.  And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation
or burden.1642
14.And among us are Muslims [in submission to AllŒh], and among

those have sought out the right course.

17.So We might test them therein.  And whoever turns away 
from the remembrance of his Lord1644He will put into arduous

18.And [He revealed] that the masjids1645are for All Œh, so do not 
invoke with All Œh anyone.

1.O you who wraps himself [in clothing],1650
2.Arise [ to pray] the night, except for a little –
3.Half of it –or subtract from it a little
4.Or add to it, and recite the QurÕ Œn with measured recitation.
5.Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.1651
6.Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence
[of heart and tongue]1652and more suitable for words.1653
7.Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.
8.And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to 
Him with [complete] devotion.
9.[He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity 
except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs.1654
10.And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious
avoidance.

wrapped in his garments.1651i.e., the revelation, which when descending on the Prophet () bore 
down upon him with a great weight.  Another meaning is "important 
ordinances."1652Anot her accepted interpretation of the same words is "Indeed, arising at 
night is more difficult...," meaning that it will only be done by sincere 
believers and not others.1653i.e., for recitation of the QurÕ Œn and for hearing and understanding it.1654i.e., trust in All Œh and rely upon Him.

17.Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a Day that will make
the children white -haired?1655
18.The heaven will break apart therefrom;1656ever is His promise 
fulfilled.
19.Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his 
Lord a way.
20.Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muúammad ], that you stand [in 
prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it,
and [so do] a group of those with you.  And All Œh determines 
[the extent of] the night and the day.  He has known that you 
[Muslims] will not be able to do it1657and has turned to you in 
forgiveness, so recite what is e asy [for you] of the QurÕ Œn.  He 
has known that there will be among you those who are ill and 
others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of 
the bounty of All Œh and others fighting for the cause of All Œh.  
So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give 
zakŒh and loan AllŒh a goodly loan.1658  And whatever good 
you put forward for yourselves –you will find it with AllŒh.  
It is better and greater in reward.  And seek forgiveness of 
AllŒh.  Indeed, All Œh is Forgiving and Merciful.
                                               
1655Another meaning is "How can you avoid [punishment]" on such a Day?1656From the terror of that Day.1657AllŒh has known that if they were to continue in such long periods of 
worship each night, the people would be caused much hardshi p.1658In the form of charities and contributions to His cause.

be convinced and those who have believed will increase in 
faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers 
will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., 
hypocrisy] and the disbelievers will say, "What does AllŒh 
intend by this as an example?"  Thus does AllŒh leave astray 
whom He wills and guides whom He wills.  And none knows 
the soldiers of your Lord except Him.  And it [i.e., mention of 
the Fire] is not but a reminder to humanity.
32.No!  By the moon
