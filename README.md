This project comprises two distinct AI Language Models (LLMs) trained on religious texts:

Christianity LLM: Trained on a curated dataset of Christian scriptures, theological commentaries, and historical texts.
Hinduism LLM: Trained on Hindu religious scriptures, philosophical writings, and cultural texts.
The aim is to enable interactive learning, exploration, and analysis of religious and philosophical content while respecting the context and integrity of the original texts.
Features
Textual Interpretation: Generate context-aware explanations and interpretations of religious passages.
Question and Answer: Ask questions about theology, philosophy, and religious practices.
Comparative Study: Analyze similar concepts across Christianity and Hinduism.
